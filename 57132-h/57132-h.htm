<h2 id="PREFACE">PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="pfirst">Although</span> much has been written regarding the
Borgias, no monograph devoted to Caesar—the
most interesting member of the family as a
psychological study—has hitherto appeared in
English.</p>

<p>With the passing of the “great man theory,”
biography and history have become completely
separated, and a personality such as Caesar Borgia
is interesting now chiefly as a product of the egoism
of the age. Vast, unrestrained selfishness was the
predominant characteristic of the men of the Italian
Renaissance. The Peninsula was in the grasp of
a number of petty tyrants who, to advance their
own interests and those of their families, hesitated
at no crime.</p>

<p>Never before was love of power so general and
carried to such extremes. Men and women were
mere pawns in a stupendous political game. In
the governing families the women especially were
regarded as assets to be used in establishing
alliances to increase the power of the clan.</p>

<p>Men of iron played fast and loose with states<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
and principalities; to them the lives of a city’s
population were nothing except so far as their
own projects and power were concerned.</p>

<p>Of this world the Borgias were part, although
they were interlopers in the affairs of the Peninsula;
they saw other upstarts securing vast wealth
and dominion, and why should not they? The thing
were easy with Rodrigo Borgia on the throne of
St. Peter. Money in unlimited amounts was at
their command and the spiritual weapons of the
Church had not yet been cast on the rubbish-heap—there
were still kings and princes that quaked
at the threat of excommunication.</p>

<p>Other men, other families, have played a much
more important part than the Borgias in the drama
of history; others have committed as great crimes;
others have surpassed them in every field of human
activity—in fact, no member of the Borgia family
ever produced anything of enduring value to Italy
or the human race. We are therefore led to ask
why Alexander VI., Caesar, and Lucretia Borgia
have always aroused such profound interest.
Gregorovius ascribes this to the violent contrast of
their mode of living—their morals—with the sacredness
of the Holy Office. An explanation wholly
adequate; for, although there were temporal princes
who equalled or surpassed Alexander VI. and
Caesar Borgia in wickedness, the Papacy furnishes
no other example, in the person of Pope or
cardinal, of as great moral obliquity. Caesar had
been a cardinal, and in all his projects, after as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
well as before he relinquished the purple, he was
supported by the Pope, his father.</p>

<p>Drum and trumpet histories are now fortunately
fast becoming obsolete, and it is a truism to say that
any man whose claim to fame is based on acts
prompted by unbridled egoism can have little, if
any, lasting effect upon the progress of the human
race. A great scientist, scholar, or inventor may
by his discoveries change the mode of living, the
institutions of mankind, and, therefore, the subsequent
history of humanity. The overthrow of
the Feudal System has been ascribed to the invention
of gunpowder; and the mariner’s compass, the
steam-engine, and the printing-press have altered
the very nature of man; the discovery of an
anæsthetic or an antitoxin may have greater effect
upon the history of mankind than the victories of
an Alexander.</p>

<p>Mere men of violence, the so-called conquerors,
the military geniuses, whom little children were
once taught to admire, and whom moral perverts
are still wont to exalt—the ferocious egoists, who
sigh for more worlds to conquer—are the most
useless creatures produced by humanity in the
painful course of its evolution.</p>

<p>Even had these men never existed the great
historic movements with which they were connected
would undoubtedly have run their course and
reached the same goal. The Roman Empire would
have come without Caesar, and without Napoleon
France would still have become the Republic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
However interesting Alexander the Great, Julius
Caesar, and Napoleon may be as examples of unbridled
egoism, they failed to attain the ends they
sought; their conquests did not last; the victories
of fraud and violence never can endure.</p>

<p>Renascent Italy furnished numerous examples of
power built up by these means, and even the beneficiaries
knew how unstable was their dominion.
Professor Achille Loria has pointed out that
Machiavelli’s admiration for Caesar Borgia was due
to his perfect comprehension of the true nature
of feudal property and to his understanding of
the inherent necessity for the spoliations, extortions,
and crimes which characterised it; and also
of the historical justification of the acts that
favoured the preservation of this dominant social
form.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></p>

<p>The bombastic chronicles of great men are now
recognised as of slight value, for the economic
interpretation of history teaches us that the
individual plays but a small part in the march of
events, even when his character is the noblest,
his aims the highest; without Washington the
colonies would have become the United States, and
the slaves would have been freed without Lincoln.</p>

<p>A great man, especially in the domain of
politics, is the product of his age. A genius appearing
before society is ready for him is a visionary,
but if the times are ripe for him he is a genius;
the great man is he who best discerns the spirit of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
the age and enters the lists as the champion of
popular ideals. He is essentially the product of his
environment, and is so much a part of it that it is
impossible to think of him as belonging to any
other.</p>

<p>Men being products of history, under similar
conditions similar men will be produced; but as
they in the aggregate are the makers of history
there is a constant mutation in conditions and therefore
ceaseless change in men.</p>

<p>In every epoch there are men who although
in many respects unlike their prototypes resemble
them in others, and bear a close relationship to
them. Unchecked egoism asserts itself in every
age, but the mode of its expression varies according
to the institutions of the day.</p>

<p>In Italy from the twelfth to the sixteenth century
this egoism was embodied in the tyrant or despot;
it has found expression in the absolute monarch,
and in the present bourgeois epoch it is exemplified
in the captain of industry, the domineering genius
of modern finance.</p>

<p>In the fifteenth century Italy was swarming with
tyrants great and small—men of boundless ambition
and greed, striving for power, deterred by no
principle, hesitating at no crime. Duplicity,
treachery, murder, had become fine arts.</p>

<p>A host of adventurers, upstarts, brigands, soldiers
of fortune, had managed to secure possession of
the domain of St. Peter and were building up
petty principalities for themselves and their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
kinsmen. Originally these tyrants were feudatories
of the Holy See, which based its claim to the
territory on the donation of the Countess Matilda,
who, dying in 1115, left her vast estates, which
extended from Mantua to Pisa and thence almost
to the walls of Rome, to the Pope.</p>

<p>As soon as these vassals of the Holy See felt
themselves strong enough they refused all allegiance
and declined to pay their annual tribute.
Alexander VI. was thus afforded an excellent pretext
for attempting to recover St. Peter’s domain—and
this he set about doing, ostensibly for the
Church, but in reality to build up a kingdom in
central Italy for the benefit of his family.</p>

<h2 id="BIBLIOGRAPHY">BIBLIOGRAPHY</h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="pfirst">The</span> writer desires to acknowledge his indebtedness
to the authorities named below, especially to Alvisi
for the details of the campaigns in the Romagna,
and to Yriarte for genealogical data and particulars
regarding Caesar’s life after his seizure by Gonsalvo
de Cordova. Yriarte appears finally to have settled
the mooted question of the descent of Rodrigo
Borgia, Alexander VI.; and to have proved that
he was a Borgia on both the maternal and paternal
sides, and not merely on his mother’s; that he was
Borja y Borja and not Llançol y Borja; and that
he never had the name of Lenzo,<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> consequently did
not relinquish it and assume that of his mother’s
brother.</p>

<p>The dispatches of Giustinian, Venetian ambassador
to the Vatican from May 27, 1502, to
April 26, 1505, edited by the profound scholar
Professor Pasquale Villari, have been of the utmost
value. The ambassador watched every move made
by the Vatican as if the very life of his beloved
republic depended on it, and with great perspicacity
he followed the extraordinary political drama that
was being enacted in Rome.</p>

<p>Burchard’s diary is also an inexhaustible mine
of information concerning the pontificate of Alexander
VI. and the earlier years of the reign of
Julius II. This Alsatian Master of Ceremonies is
a wholly passionless recording machine, so automatic
that one immediately discovers that he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
no moral sense whatever. Only once does he
display any feeling—when the swashbucklers of
Charles VIII. placed some of their horses in “my
stable, where they devoured my hay and oats, so
I had them removed to the stable of one of my
neighbours”—a very human act on the part of the
Master of Ceremonies.</p>

<p>On account of Burchard’s calm relation of the
crimes and scandals connected with the reign of
Alexander VI. efforts have been made to discredit
the <cite>Diarium</cite>. It has been claimed that all the available
manuscripts are not only inexact but also that
they are largely fabrications of the enemies of the
Papacy; it has also been maintained that Burchard’s
original manuscript is not in existence.</p>

<p>The diary was published complete for the first
time by M. Thuasne (1883–5) in three octavo
volumes. His text is derived from the Paris manuscript,
an almost exact reproduction of that in the
Chigi Palace which was copied from the original
in the Vatican by order of Alexander VII.—Fabio
Chigi. M. Thuasne has corroborated the statements
of the diary in innumerable instances with notes
from other sources and a large number of hitherto
inedited documents.</p>

<p>Burchard, recording the crimes and scandals of
the Vatican under Alexander VI., has been compared
with Procopius flaying the vices of the Court
of Justinian—but the comparison is inapt. Burchard
himself had bought the office of Papal
Master of Ceremonies, and he had no sense of
shame. Alexander tolerated him and Caesar evidently
did not think him worth putting to death.
As Master of Ceremonies he was minute, trivial,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
exact, indispensable; to him the salvation of a
thousand souls was far less important than the
proper donning of a vestment or the swinging of
a censer. As a recorder of what was going on
about him he was matchless because he was utterly
passionless; fearless he undoubtedly was—perhaps
because of his stupidity; he was a mere piece of
mechanism; his function was to record, to
chronicle everything—fact and rumour—and not
to judge, not to analyse. As complacently as a
modern newspaper reporter describes the reception
given by a pork packer, he depicts the banquet of
harlots given by Alexander VI. in the Vatican—and
with much less opulence of adjective. That
Christ’s Vicar on earth should go about the apartment
pouring confetti in the bodices of the women,
whom he had just entertained with “certain
obscene comedies,” did not seem to the Master
of Ceremonies worthy of any special comment.
He merely records; never does he show surprise,
contempt, hate; he never criticises, never censures.
He is entirely different from Infessura, who, as an
Italian and a patriot, betrays his hatred of the
Papacy on every page. Burchard, the Alsatian,
apparently had little, if any, personal concern with
Italian politics, and it is precisely his lack of feeling
that renders his diary the most valuable authority
extant on the pontificate of Alexander VI.</p>

<p>Burchard was born about the middle of the
fifteenth century; he was early intended for the
priesthood, but soon abandoned his theological
studies to take up the law; he appeared in Rome
in 1481 and immediately secured a position as
apostolic prothonotary. He decided to purchase<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
the office of Master of Ceremonies, when a vacancy
should occur, and with this end in view engaged
in a long course of study. In 1483 he attained
his ambition.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center b2">The Renaissance—The Papacy in the fifteenth century—The
Borgia.</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0"><span class="pfirst">Possessing</span> a mild climate and a fertile soil, Italy
from the earliest times has attracted the invader,
the adventurer. Extending out into the Mediterranean,
she has been exposed to attacks on all
sides, and when the Roman Empire, disintegrated
by its own corruption and wickedness, had passed
away, no strong central power was left to repel the
marauders who swarmed into the peninsula from
all sides.</p>

<p>The rich plains of the north attracted the
Teutonic tribes who established the Lombard
Kingdom, and from the south came the Arabs,
bringing their arts and crafts to Sicily. To the
Orient the merchants of Venice went for their perfumes,
their spices, their gorgeous stuffs, their
stamped leathers, and with them they brought back
much of the civilisation of the Far East.</p>

<p>Owing to her geographical position, to conditions
resulting from her past history, and the prizes she
offered the bold and unscrupulous, Italy at an early<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
date became the battle-ground of Europe. Human
ambitions and energies now have the entire globe
for their field, but before America was discovered
little was known of either Africa or Asia, consequently
civilisation was almost entirely restricted
to Western Europe.</p>

<p>Italy was a seething cauldron of life and activity,
and there sprang into being a race of strong, many-sided
individuals. Like Spain, she became, in the
fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, a land of mighty
personalities, of men of varied gifts and vast
energy. While Spain gave the world Cortez,
Murillo, Velazquez, Calderon, Charles V., Loyola,
Alva, and Gonsalvo de Cordova, Italy produced
Columbus, Michael Angelo, Raphael, Ariosto,
Ludovico il Moro, St. Francis, Prospero Colonna,
and Julius II.</p>

<p>Students have ever been fascinated by those
periods in the world’s history which have been
characterised by unusual activity in the domains
of art, letters, science, and politics. The marvellous
flowering in architecture and sculpture in
the age of Pericles, in poetry and the drama in
the time of Elizabeth, and in all the arts during
the vaguely defined period of the Italian Renaissance
have never ceased to baffle the historian and
the psychologist.</p>

<p>Professor Gebhart, in a work of great erudition<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a>
has endeavoured to account for the civilisation of
the Italian Renaissance by reference to “the
inherent characteristics of the Italian soul; to
certain great and persistent tendencies in her intellectual
life, and to certain facts in her political<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
career—causes which affect the entire life of the
people; some of which were remote in time, but
of lasting effect, while others were recent and
transitory.”</p>

<p>In all fields of worthy human endeavour men in
Italy had constantly before them the inspiration of
splendid achievement; but they were also confronted
by examples of evil, vast and successful,
reaping material rewards such as rarely fall to the
lot of virtue. Throughout Italy, in the age of the
Borgia, impudent but brave and crafty adventurers
were establishing princely houses, enjoying boundless
dominion and wealth—and could their example
have been lost on Alexander VI. and Caesar Borgia?</p>

<p>The Renaissance in Italy was much more than
a revival in literature and the graphic arts; it was
the supreme development of Italian civilisation as a
whole, the most perfect expression of the genius
and intellectual life of the peninsula.</p>

<p>The chief causes of the Italian Renaissance,
causes inherent in Italy herself, were, above all,
liberty of the individual mind and social freedom.
The persistence of Latin traditions, and the ever-present
memory of Greece were likewise potent
factors; while the language reached maturity at
exactly the right moment. The affluents that came
later to swell the movement and hasten the development
of the peninsula were the foreign civilisations,
Byzantine, Arabian, Norman, Provençal and
French.</p>

<p>The Italian spirit has always been essentially
practical; abstractions have never appealed to it
as anything more than mental gymnastics; for pure
metaphysics the Italians cared but little; the whole<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
tendency of their philosophy was utilitarian. In
Dante’s “Convito” the question of pure being, the
universals, matter and force are subordinate subjects;
the “Banquet” is chiefly concerned with
discussions of manners; the happiness and welfare
of humanity, the government of cities—it is the
work, not of a metaphysician, but of a publicist
and moralist—ethics is placed above metaphysics;
its philosophy is wholly practical.</p>

<p>The chosen study of the Italian universities was
jurisprudence. Law, the offspring of pure reason
and experience seeking to reconcile changeable
conditions with the immutable principles of
justice, assumed, owing to the importance of the
interests it endeavoured to harmonise—interests
upon which rest the government and peace of the
world—the first place in the universities of the
peninsula. Roman law was the favourite discipline
of mediaeval Italy.</p>

<p>The Papacy and the Empire; the relations and
the limits of the spiritual power with reference to
the temporal and feudal power; the universal
monarchy, and the freedom of the cities—such were
the weighty problems to which Italy devoted her
intellect. Jurisprudence controlled all her mental
activities just as absolutely as scholasticism did those
of France. The juristprudents Accorso and his
sons, Jacopo of Arena, Cino da Pistoja, Bartolo
and Baldo, were the men who lent lustre to the
Italian universities of the thirteenth century. Law
was the basis of a liberal education. Petrarch had
studied it. His contempt for the scholasticism of
“the disputatious city of Paris” is well known.
One of his favourite sayings was: “The object of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
education is to teach men to think, and not merely
to teach them to argue.” Logic he regarded simply
as a useful tool.</p>

<p>The freedom the Italians displayed in their intellectual
life was manifest also in their religious
conscience—and this is one of the most striking
characteristics of their genius. During the Middle
Ages they resembled none of the other members of
the great family of Christian nations. Subtle metaphysics,
refined theology, strict regime, dogmatism,
elaborate ritual, restless casuistry, all were repellent
to the Italian genius. The Italian regarded the
Church of Italy as the Universal Church and as
largely his handiwork. In St. Peter’s chair, in the
Sacred College, in the great monastical institutions
he sees himself; he knows human passions prevail
there as well as elsewhere—consequently he does
not hesitate to enter the Church. This is why they
never found the national religion a too heavy
burden, why they seldom seceded and founded sects.
Italy never originated any great national heresy
or beheld any general religious uprisings like the
popular movements initiated by Peter Waldo,
Wyclif, Huss, and Luther, although later numerous
heresies from other parts of Europe entered the peninsula.
When other countries were burning witches
and heretics at the stake Italy put Dolcino di
Novara and Francesco da Pistoja to death for advocating
the abolition of private property. In 1327
the poet Cecco d’Ascoli was burned at the stake
for practising astrology and necromancy, but in
1452 the priest Niccolò da Verona, condemned in
Bologna for sorcery, was taken from the stake
by the populace and saved. Savonarola suffered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
martyrdom, not for his religious theories, but for
his political dreams.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></p>

<p>The Italians never spared the Papacy. Dante
placed Pope Anastasius in the red-hot sepulchre of
the heresiarchs, and Boniface VIII. in the circle of
the simoniacs with Nicholas III., and to St. Peter
in Paradise he ascribes these ghibelline words:
“He who on earth now usurps my seat before the
Son of God, has made of my tomb a sink of blood
and filth.” And Petrarch describes the papal city
of Avignon as “a sewer in which is collected all
the filth of the universe.”</p>

<p>Without an appreciation of the Italian character
and a knowledge of conditions in the peninsula
before and during the Renaissance it is impossible
to understand how such men as Sixtus IV. and
Alexander VI. could have been chosen to fill the
chair of St. Peter.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>By the end of the fifteenth century the Papacy
had almost entirely lost its sacred character and
had become a political prize for which all the
powerful families contended. It was an office to
which any cardinal, regardless of his fitness, might
aspire.</p>

<p>Like Naples, Florence, Milan, Perugia, and all
the other petty despotisms of the peninsula, it was
a secular principality with the sole difference that
its head had certain priestly functions to perform
and that he was an elected not an hereditary
sovereign. Owing to this latter fact it was the
most corrupt of all at this time, and its corruption
was all the more vile and hideous because of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
contrast between the theoretical sacredness and the
actual baseness of its head.</p>

<p>In the course of the centuries the Papacy had
evolved the astonishing and absurd fiction that the
occupant of St. Peter’s chair had the right to make
and unmake sovereigns at will; and princes and
potentates made a pretence of yielding to this
doctrine, knowing that the Church, being able to
control the thoughts, actions, and conscience of the
ignorant masses, by the terror it inspired, was the
strongest ally they could have to maintain them
in their usurped and illegitimate domination over
those whom they called their subjects and whose
subjection had always originated in acts of violence
on the part of their masters.</p>

<p>The Papacy was the greatest office in Christendom.
It enjoyed a vast income; the patronage,
the benefices at its disposal, were innumerable, and
during the period of the Renaissance they were
usually sold to the highest bidder. Owing to the
vast power of the Pope as the arbiter of the
destinies of mankind beyond the grave, as well
as in this world, his friendship and support were
sought by all the potentates of Europe. Being
human, it is quite natural that he was always ready
to profit by this circumstance. The humblest priest
might aspire to the great office, and if he was
sufficiently astute and corrupt might attain it.
During the fifteenth century in the election of the
supreme head of the Church votes were bought
and sold even more brazenly than they are to-day
on the occasion of the election of a United States
senator, and the rabble made bets on the result
just as they now do on the outcome of a political<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
contest. Giustinian records the odds that were
given on the election of Giuliano della Rovere
against his rivals.</p>

<p>Just as only a wealthy man, a member of a great
family, or a representative of a powerful interest
can now hope to attain a high political office, so
in those days none other could hope to reach the
Papacy, except when the rivalry among the leading
aspirants was so intense that some obscure
member of the Sacred College—a “dark horse”—was
selected as a compromise candidate; and it is
worthy of note that the one so selected was
generally in such poor health or so decrepit that
he could not hold the office long, and consequently
during the period between his election and his
death the rival candidates would have another
opportunity to develop their respective forces and
strengthen their tactics for a new election. It therefore
seems that the Divine influences which were
supposed to preside over the election of a Pope
were somewhat uncertain in their operation, or that
the influences of the Borgia, the Piccolomini, the
Della Rovere, the Cibo, and the Medici factions
outweighed the supernatural, and there is ample
evidence to show that this was precisely their view.
A story is told of a certain cardinal who, it was
noticed during the conclave, was bowed and bent
beneath the weight of years and infirmities; indeed,
he was scarcely able to hold up his head—his eyes
were ever on the ground. “Surely,” said his
colleagues, “he will soon go to his reward—we
will make him our Pope.” Immediately after his
election his eyes brightened, his voice grew strong,
he straightened up erect—and the Princes of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
Church marvelled greatly. “Whence this change?”
they asked; “to what miracle is it due? You
were bent—your eyes ever on the ground—but
now——!”</p>

<p>“Ah! my beloved children, I was only looking
for the keys of St. Peter—and I have found
them!”</p>

<p>Any strong candidate for the great honour and
the vast emoluments of the Holy Office could count
on the vigorous support of his own family and
in many cases on that also of various princes in
Italy and throughout Europe.</p>

<p>When Nicholas V. succumbed to the gout in
1455 the Sacred College was composed of twenty
cardinals, and in the conclave which followed
the three strongest candidates were Capranica,
Bessarion, and Alonzo Borgia. The contest had
reached the acute stage when Alain, Archbishop
of Avignon and Cardinal of Santa Prassede, sprang
to his feet and asked, “Shall we select for Pope,
for head of the Latin Church, a Greek, a mere
interloper? Bessarion still wears his beard—and
forsooth, he is to be our Lord!”</p>

<p>Then arose his Eminence the Cardinal-Bishop
of Nicæa, graceful as he was erudite, and, announcing
that it would be a mistake to elect him, cast his
vote for Alonzo de Borja, Cardinal of Santi
Quattro Coronati, deciding the election in
favour of the Spaniard, who assumed the name
Calixtus III. Thus it was that the Spanish house
of Borja entered into the history of Italy and of
the Papacy, April 8, 1455.</p>

<p>Alonzo Borja was born in Xativa, Spain, in
1378; he developed into a studious boy and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
became a professor at Lerida; later he was made
a canon by the anti-Pope Benedict XIII. In
Alonzo’s youth a prophet, Vicenzo Ferrerio, had
announced that the studious boy would some day
wear the tiara, and shortly after his election Alonzo
secured the canonisation of the prophetic Vicenzo,
thus showing that he recognised merit.</p>

<p>Alonzo was regarded as the leading jurist of his
day and as one of the most astute men who ever
occupied the throne of St. Peter. He was the first
of the Borja to come to Italy, having accompanied
Alfonso of Aragon as secretary. By Martin V.
he was made Bishop of Valencia and created
cardinal by Eugene IV.</p>

<p>When Bessarion arose and cast his vote—with
great tact and perhaps equal political acumen—in
the aged cardinal’s favour, the Curia remembered
that Alonzo was seventy-seven years of age and
afflicted with the gout—and his election was
assured.</p>

<p>When Alonzo assumed the tiara he pledged
his word to the Sacred College that he would keep
himself free from all nepotism—thus showing that
this was a growing evil—a promise he promptly,
broke by bestowing the purple upon his nephew,
Juan Luis de Mila, whom he appointed papal representative
in Bologna, and upon Rodrigo Borgia,
whom he made legate to the Marches and Vice-Chancellor
of the Church. He likewise made Juan
Mila, Bishop of Zamora, a cardinal.</p>

<p>The new Pope’s nephews—his sister’s sons—were
bad men in a bad age, but, blinded by his affection
for them, he did not foresee to what his passion
would lead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
Rodrigo Borgia, when the cardinalate was
bestowed upon him by his uncle, September 26,
1456, was about twenty-five years of age, handsome
and profligate. Like the Claudian family
of Rome, the Borgia of Valencia possessed great
intellectual force and physical beauty.</p>

<p>Rodrigo’s brother, Pier Luigi, who was a year
younger than the cardinal, remained a layman, but
the highest temporal honours were bestowed upon
him; he was made Gonfalonier of the Church,
Prefect of the city, and finally Warder of the Castle
of St. Angelo—in spite of the protests of Capranica
and Scarampo, who consequently became the object
of the Holy Father’s undying hatred. Pier Luigi has
been described as a handsome and depraved ruffian.</p>

<p>Even as early as this—the first period of the
Borgia supremacy—Rome was teeming with
Spaniards; when Alonzo was made cardinal
numerous members of the related Borgia and Mila
families flocked thither—their number and aggressiveness
being attested by the general and intense
hatred that was felt for the Catalans. It was
through the Borgias and their followers that Spain
secured the strong grip upon the Papacy which
she held for a hundred years—although the way
had been prepared by the establishment of the
Spanish power in Naples and Sicily. To the
Eternal City they flocked, kinsmen and retainers,
fortune-hunters, and adventurers of every sort;
they secured all the important offices; they became
utterly lawless and, justice being perverted, they
robbed and murdered with impunity.</p>

<p>In July, 1458, Calixtus further advanced Pier
Luigi by bestowing upon him the vicariate of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
Benevento and Terracina. He became the most
powerful man in Rome, and seemed destined for
a great future when his career was abruptly terminated.
The Orsini had risen to expel the Colonna
and the Catalans; and Pier Luigi, having sold the
Castle of St. Angelo to the cardinals, fled to
Civitavecchia, where, attacked by a fever, he died—August,
1458—leaving his vast property to his
brother Rodrigo, who, already wealthy, now became
one of the richest of the cardinals.</p>

<p>August 6, 1458, Calixtus passed away—to the
great relief of the Romans, who expressed their joy
at being delivered from the Spanish yoke by sacking
the Borgia palaces. Calixtus was bitterly criticised
for allowing his nephews to rule him and because
of the wretched condition of affairs in Rome during
his reign, when robbery, violence, and murder were
of daily occurrence.</p>

<p>Although Cardinal Rodrigo Borgia had found
it prudent to betake himself to Ostia on the death
of his uncle, his high position in the Church was
not shaken, and he was soon able to return to his
house in the Ponte Quarter.</p>

<p>Little is known of the private life of Rodrigo
when he was created cardinal, but there is extant
a beautiful letter of admonition written to him by
Pius II., the amiable Æneas Sylvius, from the
baths of Petriolo, June 11, 1460, when Rodrigo
was about twenty-nine years of age, which throws
a strong light on the personal conduct of the
Cardinal of San Niccolò in Carcere Tulliano.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Son</span>,—We have learned that your
Worthiness, forgetful of the high office with which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
you are invested, was present in the gardens of
Giovanni de Bichis four days ago, from the seventeenth
to the twenty-second hour,<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> with several
women of Siena—women wholly given over to
worldliness and vanity. Your companion was one
of your colleagues who, owing to his years, if not
on account of his office, ought to have been mindful
of his duty. We have heard that wanton dances
were indulged in; that none of the allurements of
love were wanting; and that you conducted yourself
in a manner altogether worldly. Shame forbids
mention of all that took place, for not only the
acts themselves, but also their very names are
unworthy your rank. In order that your pleasures
might be free from all restraint the husbands,
fathers, brothers, and kinsmen of the women were
not asked to be present. You and a few servants
were the originators of this orgy. I am told that in
Siena nothing is now talked of but your vanity,
which is generally ridiculed. Here at the baths,
where there are a great many people—Churchmen
and laity—your name is on every one’s lips. Our
displeasure is beyond words, for your conduct has
brought the Holy State and Office into disgrace.
The people will say that they make us rich and
great, and that instead of living blameless lives,
we use what they give us to gratify our passions.
This is the reason the Princes and the Powers
despise us and the laity mock at us. This is why
our own mode of living is flung in our faces when
we reprove others. Contempt falls to the lot of
Christ’s Vicar because he appears to countenance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
these doings. You, dear son, have charge of the
Bishopric of Valencia, the most important in Spain;
you are Chancellor of the Church, and what renders
your conduct all the more reprehensible is the fact
that you have a seat among the cardinals who are
the Pope’s advisers. We leave it to you to decide
whether it is becoming to your dignity to court
young women and to send those whom you love
presents of wine and fruits, and during the whole
day to give thought to nothing but sensual
pleasures. On account of your conduct people
blame us, and the memory of your blessed uncle
Calixtus also suffers—and many say he did wrong
in heaping honours upon you. If you seek to
excuse yourself on the ground of your youth, I say
to you that you are not so young as not to know
what duties your offices impose upon you. A
cardinal should be above reproach, and an example
of right living in the eyes of all men—and then we
should have just grounds for anger when temporal
princes revile us, when they dispute with us for
the possession of our property and force us to
submit to their wills.</p>

<p>“Of a truth we inflict these wounds upon ourselves
and of these troubles we ourselves are the
cause, since by our conduct we constantly diminish
the authority of the Church. Our punishment for
it in this world is dishonour, and in the world to
come it will be torment well deserved. May your
good sense place a restraint upon these frivolities,
and may you never again lose sight of your dignity;
then people will not regard you as a vain gallant
among men. If this occurs again we shall be
compelled to show that it was in violation of our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
admonition, and that it caused us great pain; and
our censure will not pass over you without bringing
the blush of shame to your cheek. We have always
loved you and thought you worthy of our protection,
as a man of an earnest and modest
character.</p>

<p>“Therefore conduct yourself henceforth in such a
way that we may retain this our good opinion of you
and may find in you only the example of a well-ordered
life. Your years, which are not such as to
preclude improvement, permit us to admonish you
paternally.”</p></blockquote>

<p>During the pontificate of Paul II. Gasparino of
Verona described Rodrigo Borgia as “handsome
and of a most glad countenance. He is gifted with
a honeyed eloquence. The beautiful women upon
whom he casts his eyes are lured to love him and
are moved in a mysterious manner—as iron is
attracted by the magnet.”</p>

<p>In 1476, the year of Caesar’s birth, the Cardinal
of Pavia wrote Rodrigo a letter in the Pope’s name,
urging him to change his manner of living, in which
he says: “What I write you will not be long,
but this letter is necessary between you and me.
Do not entrust this communication, which is inspired
by affection, to your secretaries, but keep
it with you so that you may read it over
occasionally and think of it at least once a
year.”</p>

<p>From this it is evident that Rodrigo had not
changed his habits. Love of pleasure characterised
him throughout his life. He had no less than
eight illegitimate children—five sons and three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
daughters—all of whom were recognised in official
documents. At the time of his death, when he
was seventy-two years of age, he had a mistress,
the beautiful Giulia Farnese, by whom he had had
a son, who was then five years old, Don Giovanni,
Infans Romanus, Lord of Camerino, whom he first
declared to be the child of his son Caesar, but later
in a bull dated September 1, 1501, acknowledged
to be his own.</p>

<p>It has been said that as Alexander VI. was not
an ordinary man he should not be judged by the
moral standards of ordinary men. The theory that
the great are not subject to the laws which should
regulate the conduct of lesser persons is as absurd
as it is pernicious. It would be more just to say that
the Borgia should be judged, not by the criterions
of a later day, but by those of his own age.
There is evolution in morals; the standard of right
living is higher to-day than it was during the
Renaissance, and no man of the character of Alexander
VI., were such possible, could now be elected
to the Papacy. At that time many thrones were
occupied by men who, in this age, could not survive
a year. It is, however, exceedingly difficult to
judge men of a past age, because, the sphere of
morals being a wide one, there may be progress
in one field but not in others—in fact, there may
be retrogression in some. During the Renaissance
there were men who were bad, judged by the
criterions of their own day as well as by those of
the present, but their contemporaries, ignorant of
the laws governing human progress, which include
the laws of morality, did not perceive their true
status. Surrounded by men of like character, many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
of the personalities of the Renaissance were blind
to their own depravity.</p>

<p>Nepotism was the root, if not of all, of most of
the evil in Rome, and it steadily increased from the
time of Calixtus III., who was succeeded by Enea
Silvio Piccolomini—Pius II.—who was no less
devoted to the interests of his family than his
predecessor had been to those of his kinsmen. Of
the four children of his sister Laudomia, he made
Antonio a duke, Andrea a castellan in Pescara,
and Giacomo a noble of Montemarciano. Niccolò
Forteguerra, a kinsman on his mother’s side, he
made cardinal; Alessandro Mirabelli Piccolomini,
who in partnership with Ambrogio Spannochi conducted
a bank in Rome, was made Master of the
Palace and Governor of Frascati. Jacopo Ammananti
of Siena was made cardinal and Bishop
of Pavia. Lolli, a cousin of the Pope, was given
an office, and so many natives of Siena were provided
with places at the pontifical court that it
was a saying that “all Siena had moved over to
Rome.” Even Saint Catherine owed her beatification
to Pius II., who died August 15, 1464.</p>

<p>The conclave for the election of his successor
was held August 27th. The Bishop of Torcello, a
famous Venetian scholar and humanist, addressed
the cardinals, deploring the loss of dignity of the
Sacred College and exhorting his colleagues to
select a man who would put a stop to the abuses
in the Church. At the first scrutiny it was found
that the Cardinal of San Marco was unanimously
elected. The new Pope, who was born in 1418,
was the son of Niccolò Barbo and Polisena
Condulmer, a sister of Eugene IV.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
When a youth, as he was about to embark
on a ship for the Orient, he received news
of his uncle’s election to the Papacy; promptly
perceiving the opportunities for advancing his
fortunes offered him by this event, he changed
his plans, and assiduously devoted himself to the
study of theology, for which he had no aptitude,
and in 1440 he was made Cardinal of San Marco.</p>

<p>His Eminence was a stupid but handsome man,
tall of figure, majestic, and exceedingly vain of
his personal appearance in ecclesiastical pageants.
On his election he wanted to assume the name
Formoso, the Handsome, but was dissuaded by
the cardinals, who also prevented him from taking
the name San Marco, which was the battle-cry of
the Republic of Venice, consequently Piero Barbo
called himself Paul II. and was duly consecrated
September 16, 1464.</p>

<p>During the conclave he had sworn to prosecute
the war against the Turks; to reform the Curia; to
summon a council at the end of the year; to limit
the number of cardinals to twenty-four; and not to
appoint any one under thirty years of age, or any
one who was ignorant of law and theology, or any
of his nephews, to the cardinalate. These promises
were exacted by the members of the Sacred College
for the protection of their traditional privileges.
They also secured his permission to meet twice
a year to assure themselves that the agreement
was being observed.</p>

<p>Their efforts, however, to reduce the monarchical
Papacy to an oligarchy failed. The Pope promptly
found a way out of the difficulty by presenting the
cardinals for their signature a document which purported<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
to be a copy of the original agreement,
but which was in fact very different. Out of complaisance
some promptly signed it, Bessarion under
the Pope’s coercion, while Carvajal was the only
one who persisted in his refusal. Among the
cardinals created by Paul II. were his kinsmen
Marco Barbo, Giovanni Michiel and Battista
Zeno.</p>

<p>The Pope himself, according to Corio, was wholly
given over to sensual pleasures; he filled his palace
with concubines, says Attilius Alexius, and turned
night into day, so that it was exceedingly difficult
to obtain an audience with him. The licentiousness
of his court and the corruption of his clergy were
scandalous. He was noted for a vulgar love of
display and took a childish delight in showing
himself to the Romans on all public occasions.
He desired to be thought astute in all ways, but
was merely duplicit. He was wholly unable to retain
the friendship of other potentates. He, however,
did much to embellish the city, in spite of the fact
that he was exceedingly avaricious. He was fond
of the table, gluttonous, and a valiant drinker.
Although comparatively young, his life was terminated
by apoplexy, July 26, 1471, following a
supper consisting of two huge watermelons.</p>

<p>In the conclave which assembled August 6, 1471,
for the selection of his successor Cardinal Bessarion
just missed the throne, being defeated by Francesco
della Rovere, who owed his success to Borgia,
Orsini, and Gonzaga, and also to the zeal of his
attendant in the conclave, Fra Pietro Riario. In
return for his support Borgia received the commendam
of Subiaco; Gonzaga, the abbey of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
S. Gregorio; and Orsini, famous and wealthy, was
appointed camerlengo.</p>

<p>Francesco della Rovere, born in Savona in 1414,
was the son of a poor fisherman and a Greek
woman, Lucchesina Mugnone. He was created
cardinal in 1467 and assumed the title of San Pietro
ad Vincula. He had been general of the Minorites
and was famous for his scholarship and his skill
in controversy. On his election he took the name
Sixtus IV., and he was crowned by Rodrigo Borgia
August 25, 1471.</p>

<p>With Sixtus the head of the Church rapidly lost
his priestly character and became a temporal
prince. Thenceforth St. Peter’s successors were
Italian sovereigns, and when they possessed the
sacred character it was wholly accidental. The
life they led compelled them to resort to mundane
expedients—the sale of offices and indulgences and
the promotion of the interests of their kinsmen.
Never before had such shameless nepotism been
displayed, and it now became the mainspring of
every act of the Pope.</p>

<p>Illegitimate sons of the Popes appeared with
every change in the Papacy; they conducted themselves
in the Vatican like princes; they terrorised
Rome and endeavoured by force to obtain possession
of the various Italian principalities. Generally
their careers came to an abrupt end with the death
of the Pope to whom they owed their advancement,
and to whom they were frequently valuable aids,
the Pontiff’s desire for temporal supremacy often
finding expression through them. The Popes, in
their struggle with the cardinals, frequently found
these satellites highly useful. Their power, however,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
did not extend far beyond the boundaries of
the States of the Church as they were bitterly
opposed by the older dynasties.</p>

<p>Under Calixtus III. Rome had been a Spanish
state, in the reign of Pius II. a Sienese, and
during the papacy of Sixtus IV. it was a Ligurian
monarchy, and the domain of St. Peter had now
reached its greatest territorial expansion. Within
its boundaries, however, there still remained a
number of feudal families and republics to be
destroyed. These the papal favourites, anxious to
change the States of the Church into an hereditary
monarchy, were eager to crush.</p>

<p>December 15, 1471, Sixtus made Pietro Riario,
his putative nephew, but probably his son, Cardinal
of San Sisto, and Giuliano della Rovere, son of
his brother Raffaele, Cardinal of San Pietro ad
Vincola, thus breaking his oath. Both these young
men were of low origin and no education, and
the Sacred College little suspected that one of them,
Giuliano, was destined to become the famous
Julius II.</p>

<p>Giuliano della Rovere, who was Bishop of Carpentras,
was twenty-eight years old, a libertine and
man of the world. Pietro Riario was somewhat
younger and Sixtus made him Bishop of Treviso
and bestowed numerous other honours upon him.
Pietro soon entirely dominated the Pope and from
a poor friar became a man of vast wealth. He
entered upon an unchecked career of vice, and in
two years had squandered a fortune of two hundred
thousand gold florins and become a physical
wreck. He died in 1472, leaving vast debts
which were never paid. Other kinsmen of Sixtus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
remained laymen but nevertheless were advanced
to positions of honour through the influence of
the Pope.</p>

<p>On the death of Pietro Riario, Sixtus transferred
his affections to his nephew Girolamo, probably
also the pontiff’s son, who was called to Rome
and given the title to Imola, which had been purchased
from Taddeo Manfredi. The government
of the States of the Church was entrusted to him,
and Galeazzo Sforza conferred upon him the hand
of his illegitimate daughter, Caterina, the heroic
virago who defended Forli against her husband’s
murderers and later against Caesar Borgia, and
whom her countrymen styled <i xml:lang="it" lang="it">la prima donna
d’Italia</i>. In return for the honour Sixtus made
Galeazzo’s son, Ascanio, a cardinal.</p>

<p>Soon after this the Pope succeeded in establishing
a matrimonial alliance between his family and
the princes of Urbino; for, in return for creating
Federico di Montefeltre Duke of Urbino, the
latter consented to the marriage of his daughter,
Giovanna, to Giovanni della Rovere, another
brother of Giuliano.</p>

<p>Sixtus also conferred the purple on Cristoforo
and Domenico della Rovere; upon his sister’s son,
Geronimo Basso, and also on Raffaele Riario, a
nephew of Pietro Riario.</p>

<p>It was stated that the Pope in his eagerness to
advance his innumerable kinsmen and connections
frequently bestowed an office on one, forgetting he
had already given it to another. It was even said
that Cardinal Pietro Riario entered into an agreement
with Galeazzo Maria Sforza, of Milan, by
which the duke was to furnish him with money and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
troops to enable him to seize the papal throne,
which Sixtus appears to have been ready to yield
to him; the plan, however, which would have
resulted in the secularisation of the Papal States,
failed through the death of Pietro.</p>

<p>The secularisation of the Papacy, nevertheless,
was proceeding rapidly. The Curia was becoming
more and more addicted to the vices of the age.
German travellers who visited Rome in 1475, the
year of the Jubilee—Paul II. having reduced the
period intervening between jubilees to twenty-five
years for the sake of the money they yielded—relate
that they saw nothing but nepotism, simony,
extortion, and crime. On every hand was extravagance,
pomp, and vulgar love of display. The
populace, as in the days of the Roman Empire,
clamoured for spectacular exhibitions, and these
the Popes lavishly furnished.</p>

<p>The success of the political schemes of Sixtus
demanded the overthrow of the Medici, and he
consequently, at least, countenanced the Pazzi
conspiracy, which resulted in the murder of
Giuliano de’ Medici and the wounding of Lorenzo,
who only saved himself by flight. Three weeks
later the Pope, King Ferdinand of Naples, and the
city of Siena formed a league whose avowed purpose
was the expulsion of the Medici from Florence.</p>

<p>Sixtus was a consummate politician, and Infessura
speaks of the day on which he died as “that
most blessed day upon which God delivered
Christendom from the hands of a most impious
and iniquitous king.”<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> He states that Sixtus had
no affection for his people; that he was avaricious,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
vain, vicious; that he trafficked in offices and
benefices, made a plaything of justice, and that he
was cruel and vindictive.</p>

<p>According to history Sixtus was an evil ruler in
an evil age. All his acts were inspired by a love
of power or an exaggerated affection for his kinsmen.
He it was who first completely surrendered
the Papacy and Rome to his relatives. He used
all sorts of means to increase the Church revenues,
only to hand them over to his nephews to use in
extending the power of his family. He was, however,
not wholly devoid of virtue, for he possessed
great learning. Impatient of contradiction, he used
any means to overcome opposition, and he soon
showed that he was born to rule. Sixtus IV. had
none of the priestly characteristics which the
Supreme Pontiff is supposed to possess; in him the
priest was lost in the prince.</p>

<p>From that time forth St. Peter’s successors were
temporal sovereigns who happened to be Popes;
the members of their families were everywhere
treated as princes. Many of their putative nephews
were in reality their own illegitimate sons. There
was a saying current in Europe during the reign
of Sixtus that there were as many popes in Rome
as he had nephews. With every change in the
Papacy a new swarm came into power, only to fall
with their creator’s decease.</p>

<p>The Papacy having become a temporal power,
the Pope’s kinsmen were his chief support; at
the same time, the Sacred Office was the greatest
political instrument an ambitious and powerful
family could secure to aid its advancement.</p>

<p>The papal nephews terrorised the domain of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
Church and endeavoured to obtain possession of
rival states and cities. Nepotism became a system,
and, as hereditary succession was denied the Pope,
it furnished him the only means by which he could
hope to perpetuate his power, but as we have seen
the means were inadequate.</p>

<p>The Italians promptly discovered that the same
hopes and fears, the same ambitions and passions
prevailed in St. Peter’s Chair as ruled elsewhere,
and also that the Pope was a very human sovereign
and one who enjoyed the advantage of being unhampered
by any feudal institutions.</p>

<p>The temporal supremacy of the Pope, however,
could be exercised only in the territory about the
city of Rome where there were still left a few
powerful feudal families, together with a number
of small republics whose destruction could be compassed
only through the agency of the Pontiff’s
favourites or kinsmen. In that way a monarchy
might be established which in size and power would
have equalled most of the Italian states of that age.</p>

<p>Sixtus created no less than thirty-five cardinals.
The Pazzi conspiracy, the war against Ferrara, his
treatment of the Colonna and the names of Pietro
and Girolamo Riario show to what depths the
Papacy had fallen in the closing years of the
fifteenth century.</p>

<p>Between the nepotism of Sixtus IV. and that of
Alexander VI. there was but little difference. If
the nephews of Della Rovere had possessed the
ability of the Borgia, or if political events had
occurred to disturb the concord of the peninsula,
Sixtus IV. would have secured the place in Italy
and in the history of Rome which Alexander VI.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
holds. Sixtus was the first Pope-king, but he was
far surpassed by Alexander VI.</p>

<p>Italy had fallen upon evil days; the peninsula
was teeming with corruption; everywhere there was
a mad scramble for office; every man’s hand was
against his neighbour; the Popes engaged in all
sorts of financial operations—the sale of offices,
honours, indulgences, immunities; and, to make
matters worse, foreign invasion threatened the
country.</p>

<p>Sixtus died August 12, 1484, and when his
opponents learned of his death they rushed forth
and sacked the Riario palaces. The conclave for
the election of his successor was held August 26th,
and it was found that the cardinals were divided
into two parties, one comprising Rodrigo Borgia,
the Orsini, and the Aragonese faction; the other,
Colonna, Cibo, Della Rovere, and the Venetians.</p>

<p>Rodrigo Borgia felt so certain of being elected
that he had his palace fortified to preserve it from
being sacked. Votes were openly traded for
castles, benefices, and papal offices. Ascanio
Sforza and the Aragonese, unable to force the
election of the Borgia, sold their votes to Cardinal
Giambatista Cibo, who was elected August 29,
1484. He assumed the name Innocent VIII.
Giuliano della Rovere had managed his campaign
most skilfully.</p>

<p>Cibo was a handsome and imposing man, but
he possessed neither wealth nor brains. He had
numerous progeny by a certain Neapolitan woman.
It was his son, Franceschetto Cibo—reputed to be
his nephew—who married Maddalena, daughter of
Lorenzo de’ Medici, January 20, 1488, in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
Vatican amid great pomp, and in return for this
honour, Giovanni de’ Medici, then thirteen years
of age—the future Leo X.—was created cardinal.</p>

<p>To the cardinals Innocent made all sorts of
promises which he never kept—promises made by
the man might be broken by the Pope. He was
the first of Christ’s Vicars publicly to acknowledge
his children, of whom he had seven. He was
a loathsome individual, avaricious, vicious, and
venal, and completely under the control of his
favourites. At Rome he established an office
for the sale of pardons whose revenues went to
himself and his son Franceschetto. During his
reign crime held high carnival throughout the
Campagna.</p>

<p>Innocent continued and extended the evil
practices of his predecessors. The traffic in offices
was conducted on a scale hitherto unknown, for
he constantly created new ones solely for the profit
to be derived from their sale. He sold the right
to collect the customs to certain individuals and
bankrupted the State. Rome was a sink of crime
and corruption, a market where all the world might
purchase indulgences.</p>

<p>Innocent’s nepotism was different from that of
some of the other Popes. With him it was based
on no political idea or purpose, but simply upon
avarice and vulgar greed. He founded no principalities
for his sons because he himself was entirely
devoid of force and political acumen, and they had
neither the ambition nor the ability to make themselves
powerful in the State. The county of
Cervetri and Anguillara had been given to
Franceschetto, but on the death of his father he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
sold it to Virginio Orsini, and wisely, because he
could not have held it.</p>

<p>Infessura tells us that when the wretched
Innocent VIII. was on his death-bed his Jewish
leech sought to prolong his life with the blood of
three young boys who were purchased for a ducat
apiece, and who promptly died, whereupon the
physician fled and the Pope expired, July 25,
1492.</p>

<p>The conclave for the election of his successor
began in the Sistine chapel, August 6th. Twenty-five
cardinals were present. The Sacred College
was dominated by Ascanio Sforza, Lorenzo Cibo,
Raffaele Riario, Giuliano della Rovere, and Rodrigo
Borgia. It is said that the King of France contributed
200,000 ducats and Genoa 100,000 to
secure the election of Della Rovere, whose most
dangerous rival was Ascanio Sforza, for whom
Rodrigo Borgia cast his vote, knowing that he could
not be elected.</p>

<p>When Sforza saw that he himself could not win
the great prize, he set about securing—with the help
of Riario and Orsini—the election of the Borgia,
and at the proper moment cast his vote for him.
Although Ascanio Sforza was enormously wealthy
he had his price and he was bought. In Rome
it was said that before the conclave Rodrigo
Borgia had sent him four mules laden with silver,
and also that he had promised him, in the event
of his own election, his palace and its contents,
and also the great office of Vice-Chancellor of
the Church. Orsini was satisfied with Monticelli
and Soriano, while Colonna and his family were
pleased to accept Subiaco and its castles in perpetuity.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
Cardinal Michiel was promised the
Bishopric of Porto; Sclafenati was presented with
Nepi, and Cardinal Savelli with Civita Castellana.
Others preferred cash. The Patriarch of Venice,
then ninety-five years of age, was given 50,000
ducats to provide for him until he should enter
into paradise. The few who could not be bought
were Piccolomini, Zeno, Della Rovere, and Caraffa.</p>

<p>When the Borgia found he was elected he was
overcome with joy and exclaimed: “Now I am
Pope, Pontiff, Christ’s Vicar!”—but the youthful
Cardinal de’ Medici leaned over and whispered in
Cibo’s ear: “Let us escape before the wolf gets
us into his maw!”</p>

<p>Borgia, fearing that by some mischance the office
might still slip through his fingers, hastily donned
the papal robes and directed the Master of Ceremonies
to distribute cards bearing the words,
“We have as Pope, Alexander VI.” Early the next
morning the window was thrown open, the cross
put forth, and in the silence of early dawn the name
of the new Pope was announced: Alexander VI.!</p>

<p>Alexander’s dissolute life was known of all men;
and when we remember that this was an age of
libertinism, when men expected no more of the
clergy than they did of the laity, the fact that the
Borgia’s conduct excited any comment shows to
what depths of immorality he had descended. He
was freely accused of the unmentionable vices
which Tacitus and Suetonius lay to the charge of
the earlier Roman emperors.</p>

<p>It cannot be denied, however, that Alexander VI.
also possessed great virtues. His contemporaries
describe him as energetic, cultivated, astute, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
prompt to act, and also as ready and vigorous of
speech.</p>

<p>Rodrigo Borgia had spent seven years at
Bologna studying canon law; and when his uncle,
Calixtus III., in 1456, made him Bishop of
Valencia, he also created him Cardinal-deacon of
San Niccolò in Carcere Tulliano, and shortly afterwards
made him Vice-Chancellor of the Church.</p>

<p>During the reign of Sixtus IV. he had been made
Bishop of Porto and sent as legate to Spain. While
returning to Italy he was shipwrecked and rescued
only with great difficulty. When he was cardinal
he occupied the Cesarini palace, but it is said that
he was miserly and that, in spite of his vast wealth,
he seldom entertained.</p>

<p>The Borgia made a majestic and imposing Pope;
he was crowned August 26, 1492, with the greatest
pomp and magnificence. Never before since the
days of the Empire had Rome beheld such
pageants. When the Pope, half dead with fatigue,
reached the Lateran he fainted; and again when he
took his seat on the throne, he swooned, his head
falling on Riario’s shoulder.</p>

<p>Guicciardini says Italy’s two greatest misfortunes
were Lorenzo de’ Medici’s death and Rodrigo
Borgia’s accession to the papacy.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>The Borgias were vicious, shrewd, intellectual,
and perspicacious, and possessed of indomitable
will. They were endowed with the mental and
physical force which wins success and often hatred.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
Securing possession of the papal office at a time
when all men were greedy for power; building
up principalities and advancing the family interests
and at the same time enhancing the Spanish influence
in the Holy See and throughout Italy, their
enemies minimised their virtues and magnified their
vices. They were charged with all sorts of hideous
crimes, some of which they undoubtedly committed,
and some, of which they certainly were innocent.
Their hostile contemporaries spread reports of their
evil deeds throughout Christendom, and the charges
made against them in their lifetime have been
repeated by historians down to the present day.</p>

<p>Again, the Borgias have been judged, not in connection
with their age and their contemporaries,
but as isolated creatures, or by modern standards of
ethics. Caesar Borgia has been described as a
ravening wolf among a flock of sheep, whereas, as
Medin well says,<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> he was merely a wolf battling
with other wolves, with this difference, that while
he possessed the same greediness, ferocity, and
ambition, he surpassed them all in the vastness of
his projects and in the unshakable determination
with which he carried them out.</p>

<p>To judge the Borgias by present standards is
manifestly unjust. The character of the Papacy has
changed; Alexander VI. was merely a temporal
prince with certain sacerdotal functions. He used
his great office for the advancement of himself, his
family, and his followers, as other Popes of his
epoch did, but more consistently, more skilfully.
Like other potentates of the day, he had his mistresses,
whom he did not hesitate to introduce into
the Vatican, and his numerous bastards, whom he
publicly acknowledged.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
In this connection it might be well to remember
that the illegitimate in the fifteenth century were
not regarded with the contempt in which they are
supposed to be held at the present time; in fact,
they were openly recognised and treated exactly the
same as the legitimate children, and when for
political or other reasons it became necessary to
legitimatise them, nothing was easier, the Popes
often undertaking to remove the taint by special
bulls. Gregorovius calls this the golden age of
bastards and enumerates among the reigning
princes of Italy of illegitimate birth, Sforza of
Milan, Ferrante of Calabria, Sigismondo Malatesta
of the Marches, and Borso of Ferrara, who was one
of the eight natural sons of the House of Este who
rode forth to meet Pius II. when he was on his
way to the Congress of Mantua in 1459, and whom
he described as “eloquent, generous, and magnificent.”<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a>
When the lawful children were minors or
lacking in force, bastards were often admitted to
the succession; the fitness of the individual, and
not the fact of pure or impure birth, was the test.
In more northern countries, Burgundy for example,
illegitimate children were provided for by a distinct
class of appanages, such as bishoprics. The
greatest of the sons of men did not express an
isolated opinion when he made Gloucester’s illegitimate
son, Edmund, <span class="locked">exclaim:—</span></p>

History, whose chief concern until recent years
has been the recording of the victories of fraud and
force and the perpetuation of the memory of the
morally deformed, from Caesar to Bonaparte, has
preserved for our edification the names of innumerable
bastards who dazzled their contemporaries, and
whom little boys and girls are taught to admire,
just as they are taught to admire those monsters
who, in the pursuit of their own aims and ambitions,
have destroyed the greatest number of
their fellows—wholesale murder being a glorious
achievement; thus we have Don John of Austria,
Vendôme, Dunois, Prince Eugene, the Constable of
Bourbon, and Maurice of Saxony. Not until the
sixteenth century did Italy feel any repugnance for
illegitimacy, and then it was due to the influence
of foreign ideas and the counter-revolution.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a></p>

<p>In addition to illegitimacy of birth another form
of illegitimacy was common in the peninsula, the
illegitimate power of a reigning sovereign—that is,
the usurped dominion enjoyed by a political adventurer.
We need not pause to inquire whether he
usurped it from an earlier usurper, either a prince
or a faction, or to ask how usurped power can ever
become legitimate. This state of affairs gave birth
to innumerable crimes of violence, and the dagger
and the poisoned cup were the usual instruments of
personal political advancement.</p>

<p>The origin of some of these illegitimate powers
can be traced back to the middle of the eleventh
century, when the feudal lords found themselves
confronted by a new power in the cities in the form
of the corporation or guild of artisans who had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
gradually become conscious of their strength and
importance, and had shown their masters that they
were to be counted with in the future.</p>

<p>The development of this new movement was
furthered by the Wars of Investiture, which, while
weakening the authority of the bishops, aroused
the minds of the citizens, caused them to take an
interest in public affairs, and gave them a desire
for freedom.</p>

<p>In almost every city there were then two bishops,
one representing the Empire, the other the Holy
See, and each sought to increase the number of
his followers for the purpose of overcoming and
expelling his rival; hence innumerable concessions,
privileges, and franchises were granted the citizens,
until finally, when the struggle was brought to a
close by the Concordat of Worms, in 1122, almost
all the sovereign rights—the regalia—had passed
into the hands of the people.</p>

<p>Not only were the bishops forced to yield but
the Emperor himself, the Countess Matilda, and
all the great lords were compelled to acquiesce
in the movement which even extended to cities
that were independent of any bishop.</p>

<p>Henceforth the cities governed themselves and
elected their own chiefs or consuls. They, however,
did not pretend to be wholly independent of
the Empire but readily acknowledged themselves
its feudatories. The movement spread throughout
Italy, and many of the cities became so powerful
that they compelled the feudal lords of the surrounding
country to apply for citizenship and to
agree to obey the communal statutes. These various
elements introduced into the city soon occasioned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
discord and quarrels, in which bloodshed became
frequent; in addition to this intestine warfare, the
rivalry between the different communes resulted in
continual strife among them.</p>

<p>For a time they were left to prey on each
other; for, although they were feudatories of the
Empire, the Emperors were unable to devote any
attention to the affairs of Italy, Germany being torn
asunder by the Guelphs, adherents of the house
of Bavaria, and the Ghibellines, supporters of the
house of Franconia.</p>

<p>The communal regime was an advance over the
Feudal System, but it could not survive the internal
and external quarrels; it soon began to show signs
of weakness, and by the end of the century it
was apparent that it was doomed. The majority
of the people, interested in commerce and manufacturing,
grew tired of the strife and were ready
to welcome any strong power that would assume
the leadership and put an end to the internal dissension
and protect the city from attacks from
without. As the commune was broken up into
innumerable factions it was in a peculiarly suitable
condition to be seized by any strong and daring
adventurer who might aspire to the control, and
when this man happened to be the head of the
city government, the podestà or captain of the
people, it was an easy step to the tyranny. During
the later years of the communes the magistrates
were usually selected from among the feudal
families of the neighbourhood. They were accustomed
to command and were supplied with arms,
and in addition to their supporting faction in the
city they had, in many cases, a large following<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
of kinsmen and retainers on their neighbouring
estates. Consequently nothing was easier than for
them to seize the supreme power in the city, hold,
and transmit it to their descendants.</p>

<p>Among the first families to secure and preserve
this illegitimate power were the Della Scala, who
appropriated Verona; the Este, who imposed themselves
on Ferrara; the Medici, who secured the
powerful commune of Florence; and the Gonzaga,
who seized Mantua.</p>

<p>The vast multitude which came to Rome for the
jubilee of 1300 inspired Boniface VIII. with
dreams of empire, and a year later he published a
bull in which he affirmed the absolute power of the
Pope above all princes, kings, and emperors. This
view was contested by Philippe le Bel of France,
who was supported by the nobles, clergy, and
people. Boniface retired to his city of Anagni to
prepare a bull of excommunication, whereupon,
acting in accord with Sciarra Colonna and other
enemies of the Pope, Nogaret, Philippe’s minister,
took possession of the town of Anagni and seized
his Holiness, who was, however, liberated by the
people a few days later. The Holy Father returned
to Rome, where he died shortly afterwards (1303).</p>

<p>Two years later a Frenchman, Bertrand Got,
Archbishop of Bordeaux, was elected Pope. He,
however, did not go to Italy, but established the
Papal See at Avignon, and the Popes finally placed
themselves under the protection of the kings of
France and their political authority rapidly
declined.</p>

<p>During the succeeding two hundred years the
tyrannies established on the ruins of the communes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
were growing stronger, and in many cities powerful
dynasties had established themselves, handing the
government down from father to son, or to the
member of the clan best fitted to conserve the
power, priority or legitimacy of birth having little
to do with the succession, the possession of <i xml:lang="it" lang="it">virtu</i>,
the characteristic most necessary for the preservation
of self and family, determining the descent.
Wherever the legitimate heir was found to be
inferior, mentally or physically, to one of the
bastards of the family, he was set aside for the
latter.</p>

<p>The companies of paid soldiers now began to
appear in Italy. These bands of mercenaries were
captained by the so-called condottieri, and when the
war for which they had been engaged was ended
they were discharged like other wage-workers.
Their leaders were bold and unscrupulous and had
no personal interest at stake. This system gave
rise to the gravest dangers to the peninsula; it
brought into Italy swarms of worthless adventurers,
who sold their services to any one able to pay for
them and often they turned against their employer.
They overran the country, robbing, murdering,
debauching.</p>

<p>The power of the Popes in Romagna, never very
strong, had grown weaker during their absence in
Avignon. Bologna had fallen into the grasp of
the Pepoli; the Polentani had secured Ravenna;
the Manfredi owned Faenza; the Ordelaffi enjoyed
Forli; the Malatesta held sway over Rimini; the
Varano disposed of the fortunes of Camerino; the
Montefeltre of Urbino and Civitavecchia. The
Campagna was harassed by bands of brigands led<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
by members of these families, and in Rome complete
anarchy obtained, the two great clans of
Orsini and Colonna constantly fighting to secure
the control.</p>

<p>The fifteenth century was filled with the contests
of the tyrannies among themselves; the weaker
were crushed by the stronger, who absorbed their
territories, and thus the great states were formed
and their heads became princes. Besides the
struggles with outside rivals these princely houses
were always at strife with other powerful families
within their own domain; conspiracies and intrigue
filled the day; the princes became more despotic;
rivals, pretenders, disobedient or lukewarm retainers
were systematically put to death; cruelty knew
no bounds.</p>

<p>The people were callous or indifferent to the
crimes of the lords because they were committed
chiefly against their own rivals—that is, persons
of their own rank. The populace had long since
lost all hope of ruling, and they were dazzled by
the splendour of the Court and the magnificence
of the monuments erected by the reigning prince.
The return of a modicum of the spoils, in the form
of a monument of some sort, a library, or a hospital,
to commemorate the name and fame of the brigand
has always been found to be the most efficacious
way to placate the despoiled rabble.</p>

<p>The Visconti of Milan was one of the greatest
of the princely houses of Italy, and it reached the
height of its power in the person of Gian Galeazo,
who added greatly to the family domains. With
the assistance of the Carrara of Padua he overthrew
the Scala of Verona and Vicenza, and then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
proceeded to wrest Padua from his late allies, who,
however, soon recovered the city. He put down
the Gonzaga of Mantua, the Este of Ferrara, and
the Paleologi of Montferrat, and in 1395 he
induced the Emperor Winzel to confer the title of
Duke of Milan on him. Having defeated a coalition
formed against him, he seized Pisa, Siena,
Lucca, Perugia, Assisi, Spoleto, and Bologna,
and was preparing to appropriate Florence and
make himself King of Italy when he suddenly died
(1402). On his death his states rapidly fell away;
the Pope recovered Bologna, Perugia, and Assisi,
Florence took Pisa, while the Venetians grabbed
Verona and Vicenza. In some of the cities families
that had been despoiled by the Visconti returned
to power, and other places fell into the hands of
the condottieri, so that Gian Galeazzo’s sons found
their estates reduced to Milan and Pavia. No
better example could be found of the rise, growth,
and extinction of an illegitimate power—that is, a
power based on fraud, usurpation, and tyranny.</p>

<p>Filippo Maria, the last of the Visconti, died in
1447 and a republic was immediately proclaimed
in Milan. Francesco Sforza, not wishing to assert
such rights as he may have had to the succession
as the husband of a natural daughter of Filippo
Maria Visconti, placed his services at the command
of the republic in the war against Venice. He, however,
unexpectedly made peace with the enemy and
turned his forces against Milan, and, although there
was a party favourable to Sforza, the city made
a brave resistance. Finally an uprising occurred,
the republic was overthrown, and Francesco entered
the city and was proclaimed duke in 1450.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
Milan in the second half of the fifteenth century
was one of the most powerful of the Italian states;
and when Francesco Sforza died in 1466 he was
succeeded by his son Galeazzo Maria, a dissolute
and cruel man, who was assassinated in a church
by three nobles in 1476. His son, Gian Galeazzo,
at this time was only eight years old, consequently
his mother, Bona of Savoy, assumed the regency.
The brothers of the deceased duke, however, conspired
against her, and finally Ludovico il Moro,
the most determined and deceitful of them, succeeded
in getting possession of the government,
whereupon he compelled her to leave the duchy.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Italy had awakened from the long slumber of
the Middle Ages, during which her intellect had
been paralysed by the superstitions and terrors inculcated
by an ignorant and mercenary priesthood.
She was emerging from the gloom into the new
life which manifested itself, not only in the revival
of learning and the prodigious blossoming of the
fine arts, but also in the expansion of the human
personality. Man had again discovered himself;
he had become conscious of his faculties; he had
found that he possessed a will that could carry him
on to greatness in many fields of human activity.
Hitherto superstitious, ignorant, and bigoted, he
had been taught that if he ventured to use the
intellect with which he had been endowed he would
be eternally damned. Life to him was merely a
painful pilgrimage between two eternities, through
one of which he would be doomed to hell fire if
in his mundane existence he dared to find any of
the joy of living.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
Finally some perspicacious souls began to doubt,
and in the teachings of the newly discovered
heathen philosophy they found a theory of life
more humane, more natural, more charitable.</p>

<p>The arts had been entirely occupied with sacred
subjects because in the Middle Ages the Church
was their only patron. The gloom and superstition
of mediaeval Christianity oppressed men’s
souls, consequently the subjects selected were
hideous and lugubrious in the extreme—emaciated
saints, representations of the Last Judgment,
human beings writhing in the torment of eternal
wrath. The Almighty was not a god of
pity and love, but one of vengeance. The
teaching of the Nazarene was entirely distorted,
just as it was by the Presbyterian divines
in Scotland in the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries when they proclaimed their mission to be
“to thunder out the Lord’s wrath and to curse,”
and endeavoured to frighten their hearers into
the paths of virtue with horrible tales of men
“scorched in hell-fire,” in “boiling oil, burning
brimstone, scalding lead,” sufficiently summarised
in one of Binning’s sermons: “You shall go out
of one hell into a worse; eternity is the measure
of its continuance, and the degrees of itself are
answerable to its duration.” Such, according to the
Scotch pastors, was the measure of God’s love.</p>

<p>Extremes, however, lead to revolution. A period
of great asceticism is always followed by an era
of licentiousness, and in Italy this era was synchronous
with the age of the Borgias.</p>

<p>It is no part of the present writer’s purpose to
palliate the crimes of the Borgia; recent attempts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
which have been made to show that Alexander VI.
and his son Caesar were gentle and impeccable
beings, maligned and slandered, are inspired chiefly
by a love of paradox, or occasioned by a motive
not unlike that which actuates the great criminal
lawyer whose chief victories consist in securing,
not the acquittal of the innocent but of the guilty.
These efforts, therefore, should not be taken too
seriously.</p>

<p>Like other princes, the Borgias were human, and
the same passions that prevail among the laity also
rule among the priesthood. Theoretically the cardinals
were the Pope’s advisers, an ecclesiastical
senate, charged with the salvation of humanity,
but actually they were a body of powerful and
astute politicians, appointed by the Pope on his
own initiative or at the request of some reigning
sovereign or great family whose support his
Holiness was anxious to secure. The cardinalate
was bestowed in precisely the same way, and for
the same reasons, as a minister’s portfolio is at
the present time—that is, without any regard to
the fitness of the beneficiary, and as a reward for
services rendered or to come, and sometimes for
even baser reasons: Alexander VI. raised Farnese
to the purple in return for the complaisance of
his sister, the beautiful Giulia.</p>

<p>Youths were made cardinals at a tender age.
Giovanni de’ Medici, a precocious prelate of
eighteen years, on the conclusion of the conclave
that elected Alexander VI. was wise enough to
flee from Rome; and Caesar Borgia was seventeen
when his father discovered he had need of his
counsel in conducting the affairs of the Church.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
The great houses vied with each other for the
honour, prestige, and power. It was no small
matter to sit in the ecclesiastical senate and have
a voice in directing the conscience of civilised
humanity, at a time when the masses did not dare
even to think; and to have a vote in the election of
the greatest potentate on earth, who could make
and unmake kings and emperors, and consign them
to eternal punishment at will. The vast emoluments
of the great office, the enormous revenues of the
various prebends and livings the cardinals enjoyed
need not be mentioned.</p>

<p>Their power and wealth knew no bounds. Surrounded
by their kinsmen and retainers, they maintained
princely courts. They rode about the city
in the garb of condottieri, encased in steel, with
swords clanking at their sides. In their palaces
they maintained hundreds of men, whose number
was increased, when occasion demanded, by the
addition of gangs of paid bullies and ruffians.
Every palace was a stronghold, and in addition
those of the cardinals possessed the right of sanctuary—a
right, it may be observed, which was not
generally respected unless it was backed by might,
as is shown by the frequent murders in churches
in Italy in the period of the Renaissance, one of
the most extraordinary of which was the stabbing
to death of Giuliano de’ Medici by Bernardo
Bandini and Francesco de’ Pazzi, assisted by a
priest, who “being accustomed to the place, was
less superstitious about its sanctity,” at the steps
of the altar in the duomo of Florence in 1478,
under the very eyes of Cardinal Raffaele Riario,
the raising of the Host being the signal for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
attack. The palaces were great stone fortresses
with towers and battlements; the portal was closed
with doors barred and studded with iron, capable of
resisting almost any force; within were vast courts
and living quarters for the swarms of retainers.
Many of these strongholds were even supplied with
artillery. A criminal often secured the protection
of some cardinal who, with the aid of his “family,”
his armed followers, would rescue and save him
from prison. On one occasion a number of playful
young Romans having assaulted some of Cardinal
Ascanio Sforza’s servants, the good prelate’s
“family,” armed to the teeth, sallied forth,
fell upon the jokers, and slashed and hacked
about twenty of them. At another time when a
certain Savelli, Captain of the Curia, was about
to proceed with an execution in the vicinity of
the palace of Cardinal Balue, that worthy ecclesiastic
called to him from a window and commanded
him to stop, as the place was in his own
jurisdiction. On the captain’s refusal to do as
he was commanded the cardinal ordered his
“family” to storm the prison, which they did,
liberating all the captives and destroying the
records. That night Cardinals Savelli and Colonna
dispatched their own forces against their colleague.
Subsequently all the belligerents were summoned
to appear before the Pope on the charge of contumacy,
but the only notice which Cardinal Balue
took of the order was to fill his lair with armed men.</p>

<p>In a world of rapid change human life, honour,
and the higher sentiments are held in slight esteem;
material success is the goal men strive to reach
and few question the means they employ. During<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
the late Renaissance the despot did not hesitate to
remove any obstacle in the way of his progress,
even when that obstacle was a near kinsman; and
the act was generally connived at by the other
members of the family, conscious that in those
unsettled days their own position and safety
depended upon the strength and astuteness of their
chief.</p>

<p>Italy was then divided into a hundred petty
dukedoms and principalities, each struggling to
preserve itself by annihilating its neighbour. Coalitions
were constantly formed for the destruction
of a state whose growing power threatened to
disturb the balance, and these compacts often were
broken as soon as made. Deception became a
fine art, and diplomacy and duplicity were synonymous.
It was this keen struggle for existence
which made the Italians the most perspicacious
politicians of the day.</p>

<p>Every ruler sought to attract to his court the
artist and the literary man, for he knew that the
prestige gained thereby was no slight adjunct to
his power, and this explains why many of the most
brutal and egotistical of the princes became famous
as patrons of the arts and sciences. This protection
was repaid with flattery, and to what depths
of sycophancy men will descend is attested by the
nauseous dedications of books of the day. In 1488,
when Caesar Borgia was fourteen years of age, and
by the grace of Innocent VIII. a prothonotary of
the Apostolic See, Paolo Pompilio dedicated his
“Syllabica,” a work on rhetoric, “to the ornament
and hope of the house of Borgia, the Illustrious
Caesar, whose love of letters foretells the greatness
that is to be his.”</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center b2">Genealogy of the house of Borgia—Vannozza de’ Catanei—Birth
of Caesar Borgia—His youth.</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0"><span class="pfirst">The</span> Spanish house of Borja, tracing its line back
to 1035, claimed descent from Don Ramiro
Sanchez of Aragon. A certain Don Pedro de Borja
who died in 1152—the year in which Don Ricardo,
a representative of the junior branch, removed to
Naples—had a son, Don Ximenes Garcia de Borja,
who was the founder of the senior line. His son,
Gonzales Gil, was the father of Don Raymon de
Borja, whose son, Don Juan Domingo de Borja,
Lord of the Torre de Canals—who was living in the
city of Xativa in Valencia in the fourteenth century—had
by his wife, Francina de Borja, several
daughters and a son Alonzo, the future Calixtus III.</p>

<p>As early as 1233 the Borja family had won fame,
for in that year eight of their name had hurried
to the support of Don Jaime in his war with the
Moors, and by their bravery had secured a place
among the <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">Caballeros de la Conquista</i>.</p>

<p>Numerous positions of honour were held by the
Borja from that time forth, but the height of their
glory was attained when Alonzo de Borja, who had
gone to Naples in the train of King Alfonso of
Aragon, was elected to succeed Nicholas V. as
Pope in 1455.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
Of the several sisters of Alonzo de Borja—who
on his election to the Papacy assumed the name
Calixtus III.—Catalina married Juan Mila of
Xativa, by whom she had two sons, Cardinal Juan
del Mila and Perot del Mila, whose daughter
Adriana was the wife of Ludovico Orsini and
the kinswoman and confidante of the future Alexander
VI., the son of Doña Isabella de Borja,
another of the sisters of Calixtus III.</p>

<p>Ever since the publication of Tomaso Tomasi’s
“Duca Valentino” historians have repeated his
statement that Caesar regarded Rodrigo Lenzuolo,
or Lenzol, as his father—<i xml:lang="it" lang="it">Riconobbe per padre
Cesare Borgia, detto poi il Valentino, Roderigo
Lenzolio</i>.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a></p>

<p>Gregorovius says that Isabella, the sister of
Alonzo, was the wife of Jofre Lanzol, a wealthy
nobleman of Xativa, and that she was the mother
of several daughters, all of whom remained in
Spain, and of two sons, Pedro Luis and Rodrigo;
and that Calixtus III., the uncle, adopted these two
nephews and gave them the family name; thus the
Lanzol became Borgia, the Italian form of the
Spanish name Borja.</p>

<p>If Tomasi, Panvinio, Mariana, and the later historians
are correct in stating that Isabella’s husband
was a Lanzol, their son, following the Spanish
custom of uniting the mother’s family name with
that of the father, would have been Rodrigo Lanzol
y Borja and the descent from the Borja would have
been through his mother only. But M. Charles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
Yriarte<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> conclusively shows that Rodrigo was Borja
y Borja, doubly a Borgia, his father having been,
not Jofre Lanzol, but Don Jofre de Borja y Doms,
who married Isabella de Borja, sister of Calixtus
III. Doms therefore was the name of Rodrigo’s
paternal grandmother, and the shield with the three
bands azure, which appears in all the arms of the
Borgia, in all the monuments of the Este family,
and in all Italian works on heraldry, is the
escutcheon of the Doms and not of the Lanzol
family, whose arms according to Fabrer were
“azure with a sun argent in the first and or
with a crescent argent in the second quarter”—a
device which is never found in connection with the
Borgia in either Spain or Italy.</p>

<p>The Valencian chronicle of the thirteenth century
which says that: “the Borja to the number of
eight hastened to Valencia to serve the king,” adds
that “all, without exception, bore on their shields
a bull on a golden ground.” Thus we find the
Borgia arms clearly defined at this early date,
and two hundred years later Calixtus III. used
the same arms with a border of gules charged with
eight oriflammes; finally Alexander VI. added to
his escutcheon the arms of the Doms, his paternal
grandmother’s family, three bands azure on a field
of gold, which are the arms of Sibilla Doms, of
Catalonia, wife of Rodrigo Gil de Borja, brother of
Domingo.</p>

<p>The offspring of this union, Jofre de Borja y
Doms, father of Rodrigo Borgia, therefore had the
right to place the three bands azure of the house<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
of Doms by the side of the Borgia bull, and this
he did.</p>

<p>Rodrigo Borgia therefore was the son of Jofre de
Borja y Doms and Isabella de Borja, who were first
cousins; and he was the nephew of Calixtus III.,
his mother’s brother.</p>

<p>All the descendants of Alexander VI. used the
arms which he had engraved on his pontifical seal
and which by his order Pinturicchio painted in the
Appartamento Borgia in the Vatican.</p>

<p>When Lucretia Borgia, through her marriage
with Alfonso d’Este, became Duchess of Ferrara,
she added to her arms the eagle of the House of
Este and also the pontifical keys, and when her
brother Caesar, on his marriage with Charlotte
d’Albret, was made Duke of Valentinois, he adopted
the lilies of France, although he should have taken
the arms of Navarre.</p>

<p>Now, what connection had the Lanzol with the
Borgia, and what caused the curious mistake
regarding the name of Rodrigo Borgia’s father?</p>

<p>Don Rodrigo de Borgia, later Alexander VI.,
had three sisters, one of whom, Doña Juana,
married P. Guillem Lanzol de Romani and bore him
a son, Don Jofre Lanzol y Borja, who married Doña
Juana de Moncada and by her had a son, Don
Rodrigo Lanzol, who, instead of calling himself
Lanzol y Moncada, as he should have done, took
the name of Borgia, which was that of his grandmother
as well as of his great-grandmother,
Isabella, the sister of Calixtus III., and it was this
Rodrigo Lanzol, who incorrectly called himself
Borgia, whose name finally, in some unaccountable
way, became confused with that of Rodrigo Borja<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
y Borja, subsequently Alexander VI., and the error
has persisted for centuries. Such is Yriarte’s explanation.
The evidence furnished by the arms is
substantiated by the Valencian chronicles and by
records in the archives of Osuna.</p>

<p>The Borgias were Spanish and such they
remained throughout their long and infamous
career in Italy, and they were always supported
by a powerful Castillian party.</p>

<p>That Rodrigo Borgia was Caesar’s father there
is no doubt. Rodrigo as cardinal, and later when
Pope, always acknowledged and treated him as his
son, lavishing unbounded parental affection on him
and striving in every way to advance his material
interests, as he did those of all his kinsmen and
children.</p>

<p>One of the most striking traits of the Borgia
family was their exaggerated affection for each
other and their unbounded sense of family
solidarity. Even Pope Calixtus III., who has not
been accused of sacrificing his office wholly to his
kinsmen, saw fit to bestow the cardinalate upon
several of them.</p>

<p>If Mariana is correct in stating that Rodrigo’s
eldest son Don Pedro Luis, first Duke of Gandia,
who was born in 1467, was the child of Vannozza
de’ Catanei, the cardinal’s relations with this
woman, which lasted about fifteen years, began
when he was about thirty-five.</p>

<p>Of Vannozza little is known. She was born in
1441 and was the wife of Giorgio de Croce when
she first succumbed to the magnetic cardinal,
to whom she presented four children, about whose
birth and parentage there is no doubt whatever:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
Giovanni, born in 1474, married Doña Maria
Enriquez, and was assassinated in 1497; Caesar,
born in 1476; Lucretia, born in 1480, was first
married to Giovanni Sforza of Pesaro, then to
Alfonso of Aragon, Duke of Bisceglia, and finally
to Alfonso d’Este; Don Giuffre, the youngest, was
born in 1481. Mariana makes no mention of
Rodrigo’s other children—Girolama, who died in
1483; Isabella, the wife of Pietro Giovanni
Matuzzi; and Giovanni Borgia, Lord of Camerino,
who was the son of Giulia Farnese.</p>

<p>Vannozza was simply a nickname for Giovanna,
and Catanei was a common name throughout Italy.
In numerous contemporary documents she is mentioned
as Madonna de Casa Catanei. As she was
able to hold the pleasure-loving cardinal so many
years and secure from him the recognition of her
children, various writers have seen fit, in the
absence of other grounds for romance, to ascribe
to her great physical beauty, force of character,
and intellect. Her name does not appear in the
list of public courtesans of Rome, and numerous
guesses have been made as to her social status
and mode of living; they are, however, neither
probable nor illuminating. Her obscurity is proved
by the indifference of the sonneteers and epigrammatists
of the day, who, had she been at all conspicuous,
would have made her notorious. Burchard
mentions her only twice, once in January,
1495, when her house was sacked by the French,
and again in connection with the supper that preceded
the murder of the Duke of Gandia in June,
1497.</p>

<p>Although Rodrigo’s relations with Vannozza<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
ceased about 1482 he continued to interest himself
in her material welfare. Her husband, Giorgio de
Croce, died in 1486, whereupon the cardinal, in
order that she might not be without a home and
a protector, married her to Carlo Canale of Mantua,
a scholarly, but complaisant, individual who had
been secretary to that great patron of letters
Cardinal Francesco Gonzaga, upon whose death in
1483 Carlo had gone to Rome to enter the service
of Cardinal Sclafenati.</p>

<p>Rodrigo, probably thinking that Carlo’s talents
might be useful, selected him to be the husband
of his widowed mistress; and avarice or ambition
induced Carlo to acquiesce in the arrangement.</p>

<p>The nuptial contract was drawn up June 8, 1486,
and to her husband Vannozza brought as marriage
portion a thousand gold ducats and an appointment
as <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">sollicitator bullarum</i>. The contract describes
this as her second marriage, thus making it doubtful
whether she was ever married to Domenico
d’Arignano, who, Burchard says, “had been married
by Rodrigo to a certain woman who had borne the
cardinal a son, whom he had always maintained and
recognised as his own, and whom he had made
Bishop of Pamplona.”<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a></p>

<p>With the assistance of her cardinal lover she had
amassed a considerable fortune, a part of which by
her will she eventually devoted to the purchase
of her soul’s salvation. She appears to have been
a strong, coarse woman, penurious and avaricious.
Records are extant showing that she was charged
with stealing, through the agency of her paid
servants, eleven hundred and sixty sheep from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
Ludovico Mattei in 1504, and she was found guilty.
In 1502 a complaint was likewise lodged against
Donna Vannozza de’ Catanei by Nardo Antonazzi,
a goldsmith of the Regola Quarter, for refusing to
pay for a silver cross he had made for her in
1500. The jeweller, however, lost his case.</p>

<p>Tomasi says that Vannozza was of ignoble condition
and that she succeeded with the consummate
art of the courtesan in dominating any one she
wished to control, and that she was an insatiable
harpy. The same writer states that Cardinal
Rodrigo had spent his youth in cultivating his
natural gifts with the aid of all the tricks and
artifices known to the courtier, and that he was a
perfidious, bloodthirsty, and voracious beast of
prey, but one who knew how to insinuate himself
into the favour of all men.</p>

<p>Such were the antecedents of Caesar Borgia, and
if his parentage was bad the environment in which
he grew up was worse.</p>

<p>Caesar, if we accept his father’s statement, was
born in April, 1476, for in 1501 the Pope, in
conversation with the Ferrarese ambassador,
remarked: “The Duchess Lucretia will complete
her twenty-second year next April, and in the same
month the Most Illustrious Duke Caesar will be
twenty-six.”</p>

<p>The father’s statement concerning the age of his
children, which was promptly reported to Duke
Ercole of Ferrara by the ambassador, is confirmed
by various dispatches and letters, among
which are two sent by Gianandrea Boccaccio to the
same person February 5 and March 11, 1493,
which are now in the state archives of Modena.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
These dispatches give Caesar’s age at that time
as “sixteen or seventeen years.” He was, therefore,
somewhat younger than has for a long time
been supposed, and was not as old as his brother
Giovanni.</p>

<p>At the time of Caesar’s birth his father was
about forty-five and his mother, Vannozza, thirty-four.
Of her four children Caesar is the most
interesting as a psychological and historical study,
not on account of his crimes, for every petty Italian
state had its criminal despot at that time, but
because he displayed a calculating cunning, a
shrewdness in statecraft, and a fidelity to purpose
which is rarely met with in men of his years, and
which made him pre-eminent among personalities
of his own stamp.</p>

<p>Whether or not Caesar was striving to consolidate
the numerous Italian states and eventually
construct a great central kingdom in the peninsula,
as Machiavelli believed, is difficult to determine.
Caesar’s activity, however, reveals something more
than the unreasoned efforts of a ferocious egoist
to gratify an unbounded but vague ambition. At
the beginning of the fifteenth century Italy offered
great prizes to the resolute adventurer, and Caesar’s
horizons may have been wider than the domain of
St. Peter.</p>

<p>What is known of his boyhood and youth is, in
comparison with a knowledge of the environment
in which he grew up, of slight value. A bull of
Sixtus IV., issued in April, 1480, in which he is
described as the “son of a Cardinal-Bishop and
a certain married woman,” relieved him of the
necessity of proving himself of legitimate birth;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
and an Act signed by Ferdinand the Catholic in
1481 provides for his legitimation and naturalisation.
These steps were necessary before he could
be invested with the various offices his father, the
all-powerful Cardinal of San Niccolò in Carcere
Tulliano, was determined he should enjoy. While
still a child privileges of all sorts were bestowed
upon him. July 10, 1482—Caesar was then about
six—Sixtus IV. granted him the revenues of the
prebends and canonicates of the cathedral of
Valencia; and by a second bull, dated April 5,
1483, presented him with another canonicate and a
benefice belonging to the archdiaconate of Xativa;
the following year the Pope appointed him provost
of Albar, and finally—September 12, 1484—when
according to the bull he was nine years of age,
he was made treasurer of Carthagena.</p>

<p>During his childhood Caesar probably lived
with Adriana Mila, his father’s cousin. A granddaughter
of Catalina, sister of Calixtus III., she
had married Ludovico Orsini, Lord of Bassanello,
who died some time before 1488. She dwelt in the
Orsini palace in Rome. Lucretia Borgia also was
placed under her care. Adriana Mila was more
than Rodrigo Borgia’s kinswoman, she was his confidante
up to the day of his death. Her son
it was who married the beautiful Giulia Farnese,
and Adriana was the complaisant witness of the
adulterous relations of his wife, “Christ’s Bride,”
as the satirists called her, with her cousin, St.
Peter’s successor.</p>

<p>The dedication—already mentioned—of Paolo
Pompilio’s treatise on rhetoric to Caesar in 1488
is the first public notice we have of him. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
following year he was a student of canon law at
the Sapienza of Perugia, where he also had a special
preceptor, Juan Vera of Valencia. At the university
he had a number of intimate friends and companions—all
young Spaniards—who were closely
associated with his subsequent fortunes. The most
famous of these young men was Francesco
Romolino of Lerida, one of the commissioners sent
to Florence in 1498 by Alexander VI. to secure
the conviction of Savonarola, and who remarked
to his host, Pandolfo della Luna: “We shall make
a fine bonfire; I bear the sentence with me already
prepared.”<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a></p>

<p>From Perugia, where Caesar spent about two
years, he went to Pisa—in 1491—to attend the
lectures of Filippo Decio, one of the most famous
professors of canon law of that day, and he was
still there September 12, 1491, on which date
Innocent VIII. conferred the bishopric of Pamplona
on him. Five days later Cardinal Rodrigo Borgia,
in his capacity of Vice-Chancellor of the Church,
informed the Chapter of Pamplona, and the alcaldes
and counsellors of the city, of the appointment;
and on the same day Caesar, the dignified bishop
of fifteen years, also brought the fact to the notice
of these various personages and sent them as his
representative the venerable Martin Zapata, Canon-Treasurer
of Toledo, provided with a power of
attorney, and the bulls and letters naming him
administrator of the province. The original documents
are in the archives of Pamplona.</p>

<p>In the first letter, which is written by Caesar’s
father, in Spanish, he is described as a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
<i xml:lang="es" lang="es">persona muy a nos conjunta</i>—“a person very closely connected
with us.” The cardinal adds: “The Holy
Father has decided to appoint to this bishopric
the prothonotary Don Caesar de Borgia, distinguished
for his virtues and his learning.”</p>

<p>Caesar’s letter, written at Soriano, is as
<span class="locked">follows:—</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“<span class="smcap">To the Magnificos, our Honourable and
Especial Friends</span>,—You doubtless have already
learned from letters of the Reverend Cardinal,
Vice-Chancellor of the Church, that, the Episcopal
See of your city having become vacant in consequence
of the death of the Reverend Señor Don
Alfonso Carillo of blessed memory, his Holiness,
the Pope, and the Reverend Seniors constituting
the Sacred College, unanimous in their choice, have
promoted us to this dignity, and have placed in
our hands the bulls and briefs which we hereby
tender for your examination. Solicitous for the
future good government of the bishopric, spiritual
as well as temporal, we send to you the venerable
Mossen Martin Zapata, the beloved and esteemed
canon and treasurer of Toledo, as our representative,
duly empowered to decide all matters in our
stead. We have specially instructed him to confer
with you regarding a number of matters, and we
urge you to trust him in all things and to show
him all confidence. I expect you also of your own
goodwill to aid and serve him. Should anything
special arise affecting your noble city and the
general welfare of yourselves and the community
you may rest assured that we will give it the same
attention that we would bestow on any affair of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
our own. I have only to add that I pray the Lord
to take your honourable and noble persons under
his protection.</p>

<p>“From Soriano the xvii day of September,
MDLXXXXI. Ever yours to command,</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="l4">“<span class="smcap">Cesar de Borgia</span>,</span><br />
<span class="in4">“<i>Elector of Pamplona</i>.”</span>
</p></blockquote>

<p>In the latter half of the fifteenth century, when
boys were married at sixteen, made cardinals at
seventeen, and commanded armies at twenty,
children were precocious, and Caesar, a student
in Pisa, could not have been blind to the vast
opportunities presented to him by his father’s
elevation to the Papacy in August, 1492.</p>

<p>By the immediate bestowal of high offices on
his favourites and kinsmen Alexander showed that
he did not intend to hold himself aloof from
nepotism. His uncle, Calixtus III., having set
the example, the evil had grown, and Alexander
was destined to be its supreme exponent.</p>

<p>Caesar did not attend the elaborate fêtes given
on the occasion of his father’s coronation. His
Holiness doubtless thought it wise not to bring
his son forth into public gaze thus early in the
drama. Caesar was in Spoleto at the time, and,
being a shrewd youth, he must have appreciated
the scandalous means by which his father secured
his election. The coronation took place August 26,
1492, and in honour of the happy event Alexander
made his son, Caesar, Bishop of Valencia, an office
he himself had held, and which carried with it
the dignity of Primate of Spain.</p>

OF SPAIN, ROME, 1497.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
The Spaniards were not forgotten by the Borgia;
those who already held office were promoted and
places were found for those who had not yet secured
a foothold. The Bishop of Modena states in one of
his letters that ten popes would not be able to
satisfy these satellites. The Pope’s sisters immediately
became personages of importance in Rome,
and Vannozza, the mother of four of his children—who,
after the birth of Giuffre, had found herself
deserted for the beautiful Giulia Farnese—gained
in both social position and material wealth by
Rodrigo’s election. Thenceforth she appears to
have lived the life of a respectable and influential
matron in the papal city.</p>

<p>All were provided for; the Pope’s mistress, his
innumerable kinsmen, the children and grandchildren
of his sisters, the hosts of Spaniards who
fastened themselves on the papal treasury, the
prebends and benefices—and who even demanded
a share of the lands confiscated from the Romagnol
barons. Prominent among the Spaniards in the
papal palace were: Romolino of Lerida, Juan Vera,
Juan Lopez—who was made Chancellor—Pedro
Caranza and Juan Marades, who were Privy-Chamberlains.</p>

<p>A letter written by Caesar from Spoleto to Piero
de’ Medici shows that he was in that place as late
as October, 1492. The youth explains why he
had failed to call on the Florentine before leaving
Pisa, and recommends to his favour the faithful
Romolino of Lerida. The letter, which was
delivered by Caesar’s tutor, Juan Vera, concludes
with the formula used by princes: “<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Tanquam
Frater Vr Cesar de Borgia Elect. Valent</i>.”</p>

<p>Not until the spring of 1493 did Caesar go<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
to Rome, where a house in the Trastevere was furnished
him. Here he maintained a numerous Court,
and although he was only seventeen years of age,
one of the dispatches of Gianandrea Boccaccio,
the Ferrarese ambassador, shows that he knew how
to play the prince perfectly. The ambassador
went to the Vatican to render homage, and
March 19, 1493, in announcing the results of his
interview to his master, Ercole d’Este, he gives
the earliest description we have of the youthful
Bishop of Valencia.</p>

<p>“The other day I called on Caesar in his house
in the Trastevere. He was about to set out for
the chase and was clad in a costume altogether
worldly; he was clothed in silk and had a sword
at his side. We rode along on horseback, conversing
as we went. I am on friendly terms with
him. He is intellectual and cultured—with the
manners of a prince. He has a serene and cheerful
disposition, and his gaiety is contagious. He is
very <em>modest</em>. His bearing is much better than
that of his brother, the Duke of Gandia, who is
by no means devoid of good qualities. The
Archbishop [Caesar] has never had any taste for
the priesthood, but it should be remembered that
his benefices annually bring him in more than
sixteen thousand ducats.”</p>

<p>Just what the word “modesty” meant in those
days is not apparent, for it is applied to persons
who would seem to have possessed little of that
admirable trait.</p>

<p>Ecclesiastical rules hampered Caesar but little.
He was enormously wealthy, and additional benefices
were constantly given him. He was promptly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
allotted the income of the churches of Castres and
Perpignan, and thirty thousand gold ducats from
San Michele d’Arezzo fell to his share.</p>

<p>At the time of Alexander’s accession to the
papal throne Italy, and Naples in particular, were
threatened by grave dangers arising from the
contests of King Ferdinand of Naples and Ludovico,
Duke of Milan, and in March, 1493, the
former endeavoured to secure the friendship of the
Pope by suggesting a marriage of one of his
natural daughters with Giuffre; the suggestion,
however, came too late, for in April Lucretia
Borgia was betrothed to Giovanni Sforza, Lord of
Pesaro, and kinsman of Ludovico; and a coalition
was formed by Milan, Venice, and the Holy See,
which could only result in disaster to Ferdinand,
as Charles VIII., who had just inherited
the crown of France, was beginning to assert his
claims to the throne of Naples.</p>

<p>Irritated by the rejection of his offer, the King
of Naples wrote his orator in Spain that Alexander
was detested by every one in spite of his holy office,
and that his only care was to increase the fortunes
of his children by fair means or foul.</p>

<p>Some of the other Italian states joined the coalition,
and in April, 1493, the Bishop of Nepi,
Bartolomeo Flores, publicly read the articles of
the treaty in St. Peter’s, and although no threat
was made against Ferdinand, every one knew that
the purpose of the league was the destruction of
the House of Naples. Lucretia Borgia’s betrothal
to Giovanni Sforza strengthened the alliance.
Alexander hated Ferdinand because he was outspoken
in his condemnation of the scandals of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
Vatican and because he was a vigorous supporter
of the Neapolitan party in the Sacred College. The
King had opposed the bestowal of the cardinalate
upon Alessandro Farnese, Giulia Bella’s brother,
and he had also allied himself with Giuliano della
Rovere and Virginio Orsini, who, aided by those
who had tried to prevent Alexander’s election, were
holding a portion of the territory of the Church by
force. Finally the King openly supported the
rebels, furnishing them troops and supplies, while
his own son, who had gone to Ostia with Giuliano
della Rovere, joined Virginio Orsini and Fabrizio
Colonna, the Pope’s mortal enemies.</p>

<p>June 12, 1493, Giovanni Sforza, Lord of Pesaro,
was married to the Pope’s daughter, who was then
thirteen years of age. She had been betrothed
twice before, and is described as a beautiful,
vivacious, golden-haired girl. The marriage ceremony
was performed in the Vatican, and the
festivities which followed caused an uproar throughout
the city.</p>

<p>Burchard, the minute Master of Ceremonies, may
not have been present—his diary stops abruptly
June 11, 1493, and does not begin again until
January 14, 1494—but Infessura fills in the lacuna.</p>

<p>The Pope invited one hundred and fifty of the
prominent women of Rome and their husbands,
and also the ambassadors and city officials, to the
wedding. After being kept waiting for some time
in a hall, the women were allowed to enter, but
when their husbands and the ambassadors and
officials were about to follow, the doors were closed
and were not again opened until an hour had
elapsed; then the notaries who had attested the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
marriage contract appeared and informed the men,
who were then permitted to enter, that the ceremony
was over. It was said that on the conclusion of
the ceremony the Pope had produced fifty goblets
filled with confetti which, in the exuberance of his
joy, he had poured into the bodices of the women,
“probably the most beautiful ones, and this,” concludes
Infessura, “to the honour and glory of God
and the Roman Church.”</p>

<p>The chronicler proceeds to describe a banquet
in the papal palace, which was attended by Church
dignitaries and numerous women, among whom
were the Pope’s daughter and Giulia Bella. The
festivities lasted until the seventh hour of the night,
and included the reading of several comedies—“among
them some obscene ones.” Nowhere in
connection with the marriage of Lucretia and
Giovanni Sforza is Caesar mentioned, although he
had left Spoleto.</p>

<p>The tension in the affairs of Italy was somewhat
relieved by the King of Spain, and through the
intercession of Frederic, son of the King of Naples,
an agreement was reached in July, 1493, between
Virginio Orsini and the Pope. The price of the
agreement and of the dissolution of the league was
the hand of Doña Sancia to be given to Giuffre,
Caesar’s younger brother. The contract was
formally signed August 15, 1493, and the league
was dissolved. Giuffre’s marriage with Doña
Sancia, like all those arranged by Alexander VI.,
was purely a political expedient.</p>

<p>Although Caesar had no inclination or fitness for
the Church, shortly after this, September 21, 1493,
he was made a cardinal. It was at this same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
creation that Giuliano Cesarini—whose brother had
married Girolama Borgia in 1482—and Alessandro
Farnese were made cardinals, and Burchard adds
that there were certain others who paid more than
a hundred thousand ducats for the honour.
Farnese, brother of the Pope’s concubine, as the
papal Master of Ceremonies describes him with his
usual fondness for exact details, was henceforth
known in Rome as “the cardinal of the petticoat.”</p>

<p>In that grossly immoral age it is not surprising
that Farnese took advantage of the adulterous relations
of the head of the Christian Church with
Giulia, “Christ’s Bride” as she was called in
derision. The Farnese family had been of slight
importance in the history of Italy up to the time
of Alexander VI., but when he made Alessandro a
cardinal he brought them into the history of Rome
and of the world—for this act led to the pontificate
of Paul III., the founder of the Farnese House of
Parma.</p>

<p class="in0"><span class="pfirst">The</span> nuptial contract of Giuffre Borgia and Sancia
of Naples was signed January 25, 1494, but King
Ferdinand died before the marriage was performed,
and the crown passed to Federigo of Aragon.
Giuffre by the contract received for himself and his
heirs in perpetuity the principality of Squillace and
the county of Cariati in Calabria. The King of
Naples and the Pope each promised to give the
young man an annual allowance of ten thousand
crowns, and Giuffre was to be received and treated
as a prince throughout the Regno. The marriage
was celebrated with great pomp, May 7, 1494, and
Giuffre remained in Naples several months. This
alliance for a time put an end to the strife between
the Vatican and those who, supported by the King
of Aragon, had been holding part of the papal
territory by force.</p>

<p>Naples was now filled with reports of the preparations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
which Charles VIII. of France was making for
invading Naples, and King Alfonso sent Ferrante
de Genaro to urge Ludovico il Moro to oppose the
coming of the French King. Desiring the Pope’s
aid, Alfonso also requested an interview with him,
and about the end of June the Pontiff, accompanied
by three cardinals, set out to meet him at Vicovaro.
Burchard describes the departure of the Pope in
great detail; among the cardinals in his suite was
his Eminence of Valencia.</p>

<p>July 14th the approach of the King was announced
to the Pope. As they entered the town
Caesar, Cardinal of Valencia, who had gone to
escort his Majesty, rode on the King’s left. The
Pope and the King remained in Vicovaro three
days, and a coalition was established between them
and Florence against the King of France, but as all
of the allies were afraid of Charles, it came to
nothing. The Pope and Caesar returned to Rome
some time before July 17th.</p>

<p>To understand why Ludovico il Moro urged the
King of France to invade Naples it is necessary to
go back to the time of Galeazzo Sforza, Duke of
Milan, whose oppressions and cruelties were ended
by his assassination in December, 1476, as he was
about to enter the church of St. Stephen.</p>

<p>Galeazzo left an infant son, Gian Galeazzo Maria,
and a widow, Bona of Savoy, sister-in-law of
Louis XI. of France. The Duchess acted as regent
for her son, but Ludovico, brother of the murdered
duke, soon succeeded in wresting the power from
her. He also refused to turn the government over
to his nephew Galeazzo Maria, when he came of
age—at the same time virtually holding him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
prisoner. Galeazzo Maria’s wife, Isabella of
Aragon, daughter of Alfonso, Duke of Naples,
hereditary prince of the Regno, complained to her
father, whereupon, to render the opposition of
Naples unavailing, and eventually obtain control
of Milan, Ludovico hit upon the plan of inducing
the youthful King of France, Charles VIII., to come
to Italy and assert the old rights of the House of
Anjou to the throne of Naples.</p>

<p>By his contemporaries Ludovico was regarded
as the greatest political genius of the age, and the
extravagant admiration bestowed on him shows that
the adoption of any means to egotistic purposes
was regarded not only as justifiable but also as
commendable. Ludovico accepted the applause as
his due, and boasted that “the Pope was his chaplain,
the Emperor his condottiere, Venice his
chamberlain, and the King of France his courier
to come and go at his bidding.”</p>

<p>Charles VIII. was a visionary, weak, headstrong
young man, and, disregarding the advice of his
counsellors, he readily fell in with Ludovico’s plans.
Vast preparations were made for war; a great
army was gathered at Vienne and a large amount
of artillery of a size hitherto unknown in Italy was
sent to Genoa. Before Charles entered the peninsula,
however, Don Federico began the war by
an attack on Genoa, which, however, was unsuccessful.</p>

<p>Finally, August 23, 1494, Charles himself left
Vienne and crossed the Alps to Asti, where he fell
ill. On his recovery he visited his cousin, the
deposed Duke of Milan, and his young wife, who
were kept by Ludovico in the castle of Pavia. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
Duchess pleaded for her husband and infant son
and for her father and family, against whom Charles
was advancing.</p>

<p>Shortly after the King’s visit the young duke
died, and it was generally believed that he had
been poisoned by his uncle, Ludovico.</p>

<p>Charles had sent an ambassador, Philippe de
Commines, to endeavour to obtain the support of
the Venetians, but they held aloof. The envoy
explained that the King desired their aid and
counsel in his undertaking; to which they replied
that he was indeed most welcome, but that they
could not give him any help, as they were afraid
of the Turk—although they were at peace with him—and
as to advising such a wise King, and one
who already had such able counsellors, it would be
great presumption on their part; nevertheless, they
would much rather assist than injure him. They
were careful to talk and also act with circumspection.
“I believe their affairs are conducted more
judiciously than those of any other power or prince
in the whole world,” concludes Commines. As
Venice would not assist him, it was necessary for
Charles to secure Florence before advancing into
Naples. He therefore decided to march through
Tuscany, where he encountered no opposition, the
cities in many cases voluntarily opening their gates
to him and asking his protection.</p>

<p>The citizens of Florence were well disposed
toward the French, hoping they would help them
to throw off the tyranny of Piero de’ Medici, who
refused to desert Naples. Charles therefore entered
Tuscany and laid siege to Sarzana, whereupon
Piero’s courage failed, and he secretly tried to make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
terms for himself. His situation had become so
desperate that he offered to give up Pisa, Leghorn,
Pietrasanta, and Librafatta, and he also agreed that
the Republic should advance Charles a large sum
of money. On learning of this the Florentines
became so incensed that Piero fled and took refuge
at the Court of Giovanni Bentivoglio of Bologna
and never returned. After a short stay in Pisa
and Florence the King set out for Rome.</p>

<p>At that time the French army was greatly
superior to the armies of Italy. Charles’s cavalry
consisted of <em>lances</em>, each composed of a heavily-armed
man-at-arms and his three or four attendants;
they and their horses were well equipped.
The great strength of the French infantry, however,
lay in the Swiss mercenaries.</p>

<p>The Italian troops were subjects of various states
and were under the command of their own captains
and were paid by them; consequently cohesion
and discipline were entirely lacking in the armies
of the peninsula. The Italian foot-soldiers
were inferior to the Swiss, who were regarded
as the best in the world. In addition to their
heavy guns the French had a large number
of light brass field-pieces, which could be easily
moved about, and which threw iron balls, and were
discharged with considerable rapidity, while the
Italian guns were so heavy that they could be moved
only by oxen and with the greatest difficulty; their
ammunition consisted of heavy stone balls.</p>

<p>In the fifteenth century wars the loss of life was
slight—notwithstanding the blood-curdling accounts
of contemporary chroniclers. The defensive armour
was so massive that it was difficult to kill a man,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
although it was comparatively easy to unhorse
him.</p>

<p>War is a trade—in spite of the efforts of the
advocates of brute force to glorify it. Wars were
usually brought about then by adventurers bent on
gain, as they are now, by the so-called captains of
industry—who control all civilised Governments—for
the extension of commerce, but always, of course, in
the sacred name of patriotism, which Dr. Johnson
described as “the last refuge of a scoundrel.” The
leaders and the men in their pay fought for any
state which hired them, and they might at any time
change employers. The famous Italian captains
played the game of war with great profit to themselves
and no little skill.</p>

<p>While the French troops were overrunning the
Patrimonium Petri a body of their cavalry under
Monsignor Yves d’Allegre captured Madonna
Adriana Orsini, Giulia Bella, the Pope’s mistress,
and her sister Girolama, and great was the consternation
of his Holiness; his anxiety to secure
the return of the ladies set all Italy to laughing
and gave the sonneteers an opportunity to display
their wit, of which they were not slow to avail
themselves. The captain who made the precious
capture wanted to hold them for a vast ransom,
“because the Holy Father would give his very
eyes to have them back”; but Charles surrendered
them for a comparatively insignificant sum,
doubtless not valuing them as highly as did
Christ’s Vicar.</p>

<p>The Neapolitan troops retreated before Charles,
who entered Rome the last day of the year 1494;
and Burchard describes in detail the manner of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
his reception and how the populace greeted him
with shouts of “Francia, Francia! Colonna,
Colonna! Vincola, Vincola!” Evidently they preferred
France, Colonna, and Della Rovere to
Borgia.</p>

<p>All the great prelates then in Rome promptly paid
their respects to the King, the youthful Cardinal of
Valencia among the number. While the French
were in the city they committed all sorts of
outrages, robberies, and murders. It was at this
time that Vannozza’s house was plundered, and on
January 10, 1495, the Pope for his greater security
removed to the Castle of St. Angelo, accompanied
by several cardinals, including Valencia.</p>

<p>The following day the Holy Father and Philibert
De Bressa, Charles’s representative, concluded an
agreement by which the Pope was to crown the
French monarch King of Naples and was to
abstain from harming the cardinals Della Rovere,
Gurk, Savelli, and Colonna. It was also arranged
that the Pope’s son Caesar should accompany the
King of France as his hostage.</p>

<p>January 28th, after taking leave of the Pope
with many expressions of friendship, Charles
departed. At the place appointed for Caesar
to join him the youthful cardinal presented himself
with six magnificent chargers, and they rode forth,
Caesar on the King’s left. Two days later news
was brought the Pope that the Cardinal of Valencia,
disguised as a stable-boy, had fled from the King’s
camp at Velletri.</p>

<p>When Caesar joined the King he had nineteen
large chests, which were supposed to contain his
personal effects; two of the trunks were brought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
back to Rome; the remaining seventeen were
opened by the King’s order after the flight of his
hostage, and were found to contain nothing—“at
least, so I was informed,” adds Burchard, “but
I do not believe this.”</p>

<p>On his return to Rome Caesar spent the first
night at the house of Antonio Flores, Auditor of
the Ruota—perhaps to give the paternal anger time
to cool. The following day the Pope sent his
secretary, the Bishop of Nepi and Sutri, to the
King to disclaim all responsibility for Caesar’s
disregard of the agreement.</p>

<p>February 1st the city of Rome sent three envoys,
Hieronymus Portius, the Pope’s intimate, Coronato
Planca, senior Consistorial Auditor, and Jacopo
Sinibaldi, Master of the Seals, to the King to
recommend the city to his care and to beg him
not to be angry on account of the cardinal’s flight.</p>

<p>At the time it was generally believed in Rome
that his Holiness had connived at Caesar’s conduct,
but his right to give his son to Charles as a
hostage was also questioned. Caesar was then only
nineteen, and his flight was clear proof of his
powers of dissimulation and of his determination.
Charles finally concluded to ignore the matter, and
in the course of a few days the young cardinal again
appeared about the Vatican.</p>

<p>About the time that Caesar took his unceremonious
departure the Spanish ambassadors arrived
in Charles’s camp to renew the protests of the House
of Aragon, which was determined to assert its own
rights to the Neapolitan throne, and while at
Velletri Don Antonio de Fonseca had threatened
Charles with war. These protests, which were the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
beginning of the famous League of the Conservation,
furnish a more reasonable explanation of
Caesar’s flight from the French camp than does
the theory of an earlier agreement between himself
and his father.</p>

<p>The day the League was proclaimed in Rome—April
1st—a mob of Spaniards attacked a body
of Swiss troops belonging to the French army,
and Burchard intimates that Caesar inspired the
assault in revenge for outrages committed by the
mercenaries. The Pope, to avoid the charge of
complicity in Caesar’s escape, sent him to Spoleto,
where the promising ecclesiastic awaited developments.
Twenty days after Caesar left the French
camp Charles VIII. entered Naples as conqueror.</p>

<p>Ludovico il Moro now began to regret the
alliance he had made with King Charles, although
by his coming he had been able to make himself
Duke of Milan. A league against France was
solemnly proclaimed in St. Peter’s on Palm Sunday—the
Venetians having signed it March 30th—and
when Charles learned of the preparations that were
being made in the north of Italy to oppose him
and that his ally the Duke of Milan, throwing off
his mask, had attacked the French vessels in the
harbour of Genoa, he became anxious for his own
safety. He therefore arranged for the occupation
of the Regno, leaving a considerable force in the
conquered territory, and decided to return to
France. He determined to endeavour to detach
Alexander from the league, and with this end in
view he set out for Rome. The Pope was
his nearest and most dangerous enemy; the
King therefore was anxious to win him over and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
obtain from him the investiture of the Kingdom
of Naples.</p>

<p>Alexander, knowing that Charles was offended
by Caesar’s flight and by his own activity in the
formation of the league, decided to avoid him.
Therefore, accompanied by Caesar and nineteen
other cardinals, he left Rome for Orvieto, where
he arrived May 28th. In notifying the people of
Orvieto of his intended visit the Pope stated that
he was going thither to meet the King of France.
When his Holiness left Rome he placed Palavicini,
Cardinal of Sta Anastasia, in charge of the
city, and directed him not to oppose the King in
any way, and to show him all honour and respect.
The Pontiff’s escort numbered more than five thousand
men, including Greek mercenaries, archers,
mounted and on foot, courtiers, and servants.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a>
The Pope sent to Montefiascone and Viterbo for
all the artillery, mortars, siege guns, and small
cannon, which he placed in the castle, together
with the munitions of war brought from Rome.</p>

<p>June 3rd an ambassador arrived from the
Emperor Maximilian with a retinue of thirty
horsemen, and was escorted into the town by a
number of cardinals with a guard of a thousand
men, horse and foot. The following day an envoy
also arrived from the King of France. It is
believed that the purpose of Maximilian’s embassy
was to prevent the Pope and the French monarch—who
was persisting in his efforts to see his
Holiness—from coming to any agreement. While
the diplomatists were endeavouring to hoodwink
each other Caesar was busily engaged in putting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
the strongholds and castles in a condition for
defence. The evening of June 4th the Pope held
a consistory, at which it was decided to send Juan
Lopez, Datory and Bishop of Perugia, to that city,
whither the Pope had determined to go, and direct
the officials to make proper preparations for the
reception of his Holiness. It was said at the
time that it was the Pope’s intention to go from
Perugia to Ancona and thence to Venice to ask
the aid of the Republic, rather than have an
interview with Charles.</p>

<p>June 5th the entire Pontifical Court set out for
Perugia, and they had no sooner left the town of
Orvieto than a royal envoy arrived with instructions
to follow the Pope and see him at any cost.
As soon as the messenger learned of Alexander’s
departure he left for Perugia. At Toscanella his
people were refused lodging, a fight ensued, and
blood was shed. At Santa Fiora the French
learned that Guido Sforza was in command of the
citadel and they immediately took him prisoner, an
act due to their hatred of his kinsmen Ludovico il
Moro, who had betrayed their sovereign. In the
meantime the Pope and Caesar had arrived at
Perugia, and thus avoided the meeting they feared.</p>

<p>Charles had entered Rome—June 1st—and had
remained there only over night. On the 5th he
was in Viterbo, and thence he advanced into Lombardy;
he avoided Florence and refused to give
up Pisa. He reached Pontremoli and crossed the
Apennines without encountering any resistance, but
found the armies of Milan and Venice, under the
command of Francesco Gonzaga, Marquis of
Mantua, lying in wait for him on the other side<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
of the mountains. After a brief struggle at
Fornovo, on the Taro, the King with his army
of 10,000 men broke through the allied forces
of 35,000—who lost about 3,500—and escaped to
Turin and thence to France, where he apparently
forgot all about his conquest of Naples, for he
left his Viceroy, Gilbert de Montpensier, to look
after himself as best he might. Immediately after
the battle of Fornovo, Ferdinand II. with a few
Spanish troops surprised Naples and captured
Montpensier, and the French dominion in the Regno
came to an end as quickly as it had been established.
Before leaving Italy Charles had made
peace with Ludovico independently of the Moor’s
allies.</p>

<p>The danger passed, the inhabitants of Orvieto,
anxious for the Pope to return to their city, sent
a delegation to request him to do so, and June 21st
he did return, but was so anxious to be back in
Rome that he remained only a day. The Pontiff,
however, appreciated the strategic advantages of
the castle of Orvieto so highly that he made the
town a legation <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">a latere</i> and appointed his son
legate and governor for life.</p>

The Pope’s letter announcing Caesar’s nomination
is dated July 22, 1495, and is as <span class="locked">follows:—</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Beloved Sons etc. Having<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> for a long time
known of your great love and loyalty toward us
and that you desired us to appoint our beloved
son, Caesar, Cardinal of Valencia, to be your protector
and governor; and knowing that on account
of his high character and especially his sound
judgment, you can expect much from him; and
being exceedingly anxious to comply with your
wishes in order that you may know how great is
our love for you we have decided to make him your
governor for life and do so appoint him as you
will see by the proper document under our seal.
We do this the more willingly as, owing to the
great love and affection he bears you, we are confident
that you will be well governed and also
protected; and that your affairs will prosper in
all ways. On account of other matters which
concern us he is not able to go to you immediately,
consequently he sends in his place our beloved
son, Giacomo Dracaz, etc. Given in Rome, in
St. Peter’s under the Pontifical seal xxii July
MCCCCLXXXXV, the third year of our pontificate.</p>

<p class="sigright">
“<span class="smcap">B. Floridus.</span>”
</p></blockquote>

<p>The reader may well wonder whether any one
was ever deceived by such an epistle.</p>

<p>Caesar’s first act was to make certain appointments
to office which were beyond his authority,
and when the fact was brought to his attention
he withdrew them, and apologised with a tact and
courtesy which proved the maturity of his judgment
and character and at once endeared him to the
people of Orvieto.</p>

<p>Caesar concludes his <span class="locked">letter:—</span></p>

<p>“In view of the tricks and shrewdness of certain
men who have no regard for the truth nothing is
more difficult for those who are animated by just
intentions than to distinguish the true from the
false. If in future I should ever do anything contrary
to your customs, statutes, or privileges, know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
that I have been led into error by some designing
person, for I am only human and as such am
liable to be tricked and deceived.”</p>

<p>The cardinal of nineteen years signs himself
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">C. cardinalis Valentinus, qui vos ex corde amat</i>.</p>

<p>Although the letter does not sound like that of
a boy of nineteen we must remember that children
were precocious in those days and that his training
and constant association with astute men much
older than himself, who were concerned with the
great interests of the age, probably made him wise
beyond his years.</p>

<p>The letter to the conservators is dated August 7,
1495; consequently the Pope and Caesar had returned
to Rome as soon as they knew that the
French army was engaged with the forces of the
league.</p>

<p>It was about this time that Alexander conceived
the great idea of his reign—namely, to secure the
definitive submission of the Romagnol barons who
had greatly troubled the earlier years of his Pontificate.
Caesar was only twenty years of age, and
it is hardly probable that he was of much help
in this project, although he could not have been
indifferent to events about him—the collecting of
men to strengthen the papal army, the repairing
and provisioning of the castles about Rome, movements
undoubtedly directed against the barons of
the Romagna now deprived of the support of both
France and Naples, the latter the victim of another
war, caused by the determination of the Catholic
sovereigns to restore the throne of Aragon in the
Regno.</p>

<p>At this juncture the Pope decided to strengthen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
the Spanish party in the Sacred College; he
accordingly at one creation—February 19, 1496—bestowed
the cardinalate on four Castillians: the
Bishop of Segovia, the Bishop of Agrigentum, the
Bishop of Perugia, and on Francesco Borgia. The
number of Spanish votes in the Sacred College was
thereby raised to nine, and a great protest was
made in Rome.</p>

<p>Romagna, the Marches, and Umbria nominally
belonged to the Papacy, but in reality they were
governed by certain powerful families: the Orsini
and Colonna near Rome, the Verano in Camerino,
the Freducci in Fermo, the Trinci in Foligno, the
Della Rovere in Sinigaglia and Urbino, the Baglioni
in Perugia, the Vitelli in Città di Castella, the Sforza
in Pesaro, the Malatesta in Rimini, the Manfredi
in Faenza, the Bentivoglio in Bologna, and the
Este in Ferrara. These families Alexander determined
to destroy, ostensibly to recover the territory
for the Church, but actually to build up a great
principality for his family.</p>

<p>To carry out his design, however, the Pope had
to find a reasonable pretext, and this he readily did,
for when the King of France came to Italy the
Orsini had entered into a treaty by which they
were to help him, although they had hitherto supported
the House of Aragon. Alexander could
not have had a better excuse for crushing them;
accordingly June 1, 1496, in public consistory he
had a bull read declaring Virginio, Gian Giordano,
Paolo and Carlo Orsini, and Bartolomeo d’Alviano
rebels and deprived of their estates for having
sided with the French and borne arms against the
Church. Their ruin was hastened by the surrender<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
of Aversa, July 23rd, when Virginio, the head of
the family, was taken prisoner.</p>

<p>To carry out his plan the Pope summoned his
son Giovanni, Duke of Gandia, to Rome, intending
to confer on him the office of Gonfalonier of the
papal forces, a position his elder brother, Pier
Luigi, had previously held. Giovanni was born
in 1474; he was therefore two years older than
Caesar. In 1492 he had married Doña Maria
Enriquez, a niece of the Catholic Sovereigns, and
he seemed destined for a great career.</p>

<p>When Giovanni reached Rome, August 10,
1496, the Cardinal of Valencia, accompanied by
the entire Court on horseback, went to meet him
at the Porta Pertusa, and escorted him in great
state to the papal palace.</p>

<p>Giovanni found his sister Lucretia and his brother
Giuffre married into two of the great families of
the peninsula and his brother Caesar an enormously
wealthy Prince of the Church.</p>

<p>So many benefices had been conferred on him
that he was one of the richest of the cardinals.
At this time Caesar’s secretary was Carlo Valgulio
of Brescia, a famous scholar, who dedicated his “De
Contemplatione Orbium Excelsorum Disputatio,”
a translation from Cleomedes, to his master with
the usual flattery.</p>

<p>Towards the end of October the Duke of Gandia
was made Captain-General of the Pontifical forces,
and, together with the Duke of Urbino and several
of the Colonna, with all his men, arms, and
machines of war, set out for Anguillara for the
purpose of seizing the estates of the Orsini.</p>

<p>In less than a month they took ten castles, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
during this time Bartolomeo d’Alviano made a raid
up to the very walls of Rome and just missed
capturing Caesar, who was hunting; the cardinal
only saved himself by flight.</p>

<p>Carlo Orsini arrived at Soriano January 26,
1497, with the troops of Vitellozzo Vitelli, and
after a fierce struggle the Duke of Urbino was
captured. In the fight the Duke of Gandia was
slightly wounded in the face. Fabrizio Colonna
and the legate Pietro de Luna were forced to flee
to Ronciglione. The war continued for another
month, and ended with an agreement by which
the Orsini promised to pay 50,000 ducats for the
return of the territory which had been occupied
and to release all their prisoners except the Duke
of Urbino.</p>

<p>When the King of France had learned of
Alexander’s activity against the great feudatories
of the Romagna, who had sided with him, he had
sent Carlo Orsini and Vitellozzo Vitelli to their aid
with fresh troops. One after another the Baglioni,
the Della Rovere, and all who hated Alexander
and saw that the destruction of the Orsini would
be followed by the overthrow of their own power
joined the Pope’s enemies. Only the Colonna and
the Savelli held to the Holy Father.</p>

<p>The Duke of Gandia was the hero of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fêtes</i>
which followed the termination of the war. He
and Lucretia’s husband, Giovanni Sforza of Pesaro,
were selected to meet Gonsalvo de Cordova when
he came to Rome, March 15th, after the capture
of Ostia, which Minaldo da Guevra had endeavoured
to hold for Giuliano della Rovere. The
Holy Father, however, continued to look after the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
interests of Lucretia, and especially of those of
Caesar, who was given a share of the spoils wrested
from the Roman barons. Next to Estouteville,
Caesar was the wealthiest of the cardinals, and it
now began to be whispered about that he intended
to relinquish the purple.</p>

<p>In entering the Church he had merely yielded
to his father’s wishes and he had only the first
tonsure. The ambassadors noted his dislike for
the Church; his instincts were those of a soldier;
he was always armed; he was attracted by war
and greedy for power. Had he been the eldest
son he undoubtedly would have been made Captain-General
of the papal forces, for he had more energy,
a stronger will, a livelier imagination, and what is
perhaps of even greater importance in the egotistical
scramble for wealth and honours, he had absolutely
no moral sense. In the great drama that
was preparing he undoubtedly would have promptly
found his fitting part. He was as violent and overbearing
as his father, who had not dared to punish
him when he fled from the French camp.</p>

<p>Giuffre, Prince of Squillace, and his wife, Doña
Sancia of Naples, entered Rome in great state,
May 20, 1496, by the Lateran Gate. The Prince
was then fourteen and his wife two years older.
They were escorted to the principal entrance of
the Lateran Church by Caesar and Lucretia, with
a company of two hundred persons, including the
orators of all the powers, the cardinals and their
suites, and numerous citizens; here Giuffre, Sancia,
and Lucretia dismounted and entered the edifice;
thence, after a short stay, they proceeded to the
Apostolic Palace, where from a window the Pope<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
eagerly watched their approach. His Holiness,
attended by eleven cardinals—Caesar having now
joined him—received them in a great hall. Before
the Pope’s footstool was a low bench, on which
was a brocaded cushion, and before this on the
floor, in the form of a cross, were four large
cushions of crimson velvet. Giuffre knelt before
the Pope, who took the Prince’s head between his
hands, but did not kiss him. Sancia and Lucretia
followed, and were received in the same manner.
Thereupon the Prince and his consort kissed the
hands of all the cardinals. This done, Giuffre took
his place between his brother, the Cardinal of
Valencia, and Cardinal Sanseverino, while Lucretia
and Sancia seated themselves on the Pope’s left-hand,
and “all conversed for some time pleasantly
and wittily,” after which they took their departure.
The next day Sancia and Lucretia and a number
of other women, to the great scandal of Rome,
crowded into and about the marble pulpit in St.
Peter’s, from which the priests were accustomed
to read the gospel.</p>

<p>Sancia, brought up in the corrupt Court of
Naples, was a bold and perverse woman, who later
became Caesar’s most determined and fearless
enemy; she was the only person who dared brave
him. Older than her husband, she despised and
dominated him. It is said that she was the mistress
of both her brothers-in-law, the Cardinal of
Valencia and the Duke of Gandia, and also later
of Cardinal Ippolito d’Este.</p>

<p>In a consistory held June 8, 1497, Caesar Borgia
was appointed legate to anoint and crown
Frederic of Aragon King of Naples. Alexander<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
had consented to invest him with the Regno and
remit the annual tribute to the Church if he
would make Benevento an independent principality
for his son, the Duke of Gandia, without feudal
obligations. In secret consistory the Pope secured
the cardinals’ consent to the investiture of the Duke
of Gandia with Terracina and Pontecorvo.</p>

<p>Caesar was making extravagant preparations for
his departure and Gandia was completing arrangements
to go with him to receive the investiture
of his new domains when an event occurred which
changed the whole order of things, and one which
has continued to baffle historians—the murder of
the Duke of Gandia the night of June 14, 1497.</p>

<p class="center b2">The murder of the Duke of Gandia—Caesar departs to crown the
King of Naples—He returns to Rome—The Pope’s projected
matrimonial alliances for his children.</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0"><span class="pfirst">The</span> most circumstantial account we have of the
murder of the Duke of Gandia is contained in
Burchard’s diary,<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> and is as follows: “June fourteenth
the cardinal of Valencia and the Illustrious
Don Giovanni Borgia of Aragon, Duke of Gandia,
Prince of the Holy Roman Church, Captain-General
of the pontifical forces, and most beloved son of
his Holiness dined at the home of their mother,
Donna Vannozza, near the church of San Pietro ad
Vincola with their mother and several other persons.
The repast finished and night having come, Caesar
and Gandia, accompanied by a few of their people,
mounted their horses and mules to return to the
Apostolic Palace. They rode together to a place
not far from the palace of Cardinal Ascanio Sforza,
the Vice-Chancellor. There the Duke, saying he
intended to go and enjoy himself for a while before
returning to the palace, took leave of his brother,
the cardinal, and having dismissed all but one of
the servants he had with him, <em>he rode back</em>. He
also kept with him a certain person who was masked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
and who had come to him while at supper, and who
for the past month had been coming to see him
almost every day at the Apostolic Palace. The
Duke took this person up on the crupper of his
mule and rode off to the Piazza degli Ebrei, where
he left the servant he had kept, telling him to wait
for him there until the twenty-third hour, and
if he did not return then to go back to the palace.
Having given these instructions, the Duke with the
mysterious person on the crupper, rode away from
the servant to some place—I know not where—and
was killed and thrown into the river.”</p>

<p>The servant left in the Piazza degli Ebrei was
found there mortally wounded and unable to give
any information.</p>

<p>The morning of the fifteenth day, the Duke
having failed to return to the Apostolic Palace,
the Pope became uneasy, but, assuming that his son
had gone to see some mistress and that he did not
wish to be observed coming away in the daytime,
the father concluded he would return that night;
but Gandia failing to put in an appearance, the
Holy Father became alarmed and caused a
thorough investigation to be made.</p>

<p>Among those examined was a certain Giorgio
Sclavus, who made a business of gathering driftwood
along the banks of the river and who stated
that on the night the Duke disappeared he was
guarding his wood when, about the fifth hour, he
saw two men on foot come from the Hospital
Sclavorum, along the public highway close to the
river. After looking about in every direction and
seeing no one, they returned the way they had
come. Soon after two others appeared from precisely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
the same place and did as the former couple
had done, and, discovering no one, they made a
signal to their comrades. Immediately a man
rode forth on a white charger with a dead body
behind him.</p>

<p>The corpse was taken from the horse and cast
into the stream, whereupon the rider asked, “Did it
sink?” To which the others replied, “Signor, si.”
Then all disappeared whence they had come.</p>

<p>When the man was asked why he had not
reported the crime to the Governor of the city,
he replied that in his time he had seen a hundred
bodies cast into the Tiber at this very place and
no questions had been asked.</p>

<p>Men were secured in the city to drag the river;
a large reward was offered for the recovery of
the body, and about nightfall it was found, fully
clothed; even his purse, containing thirty ducats,
was untouched. On the corpse were nine wounds,
one in the throat and eight in the head, body, and
legs, thus proving that the Duke had bravely
defended himself. The body was taken to the
Castle of St. Angelo, and subsequently to the
Church of Santa Maria.</p>

<p>When Alexander learned of his son’s murder his
grief exceeded all bounds. For several days he
would neither eat nor drink, and the efforts of his
familiars to console him were unavailing.</p>

<p>The Pope directed the Governor of the city to
apprehend the murderers, but in vain. Rome was
filled with rumours. The Orsini were suspected,
so was Bartolomeo d’Alviano; even Lucretia
Borgia’s husband, Giovanni Sforza, was mentioned
in connection with the crime. By those close to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
the Pope Cardinal Ascanio Sforza was said to
have been, if not the perpetrator at least the
instigator of the murder—he had recently complained
to the Pope of an insult he had received
from Gandia. Ascanio, when summoned by his
Holiness, refused to obey until his safety had been
guaranteed by the ambassadors of Spain and
Naples. When he did appear, however, the Pope
received him kindly and allowed him to depart at
his pleasure. Ascanio, nevertheless, believed it
prudent to leave Rome for a while.</p>

<p>It was also said that Antonio Maria Pico della
Mirandola, inspired by Ascanio, had committed the
murder, and even Giuffre was suspected, because—at
least, so it was stated—Gandia had been unduly
intimate with his wife. In the effort to fasten the
guilt on Caesar it was said that both he and Gandia
were rivals for Sancia’s favours, and that, owing
to jealousy, he had killed his brother. Burchard’s
account contains all that is known of the murder
of the Duke. Suspicion finally crystallised around
Caesar, although the reasons for ascribing the
crime to him are so slight that it is amazing that
historians have for four hundred years laid the
guilt at his door; we are not offered even circumstantial
evidence; the most that is adduced against
him is a possible motive, and there were undoubtedly
equally strong motives for him against
the crime, especially if he had the astuteness we
are led to believe he possessed.</p>

<p>Even admitting he was potentially the criminal
into which he later developed, is it possible that
he would have begun his career of iniquity with
a crime so monstrous as the deliberately planned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
murder of his own brother? Caesar was then
twenty-one and Gandia twenty-three years of age.
The latter may have received great honours at the
hands of their father, but so had the former.
Caesar, a Prince of the Church, of vast wealth,
could look forward to a far more brilliant career
than could any mere princeling of Benevento. He
must have known that even the Papacy was within
his prospects, and in that age what potentate in
Italy could compare with Christ’s Vicar? Although
Caesar disliked the Church the sacerdotal character
of the cardinal was no impediment to great temporal
enterprises; like a cloak, it could be laid aside and
assumed again at pleasure; it was a distinct
advantage, as Caesar must have known.</p>

<p>There are men who are jealous of the success
of all others, but they are invariably weak
characters, and no one can accuse Caesar Borgia
of weakness; even admitting he was jealous of
Gandia, it is unlikely that his jealousy was sufficiently
bitter to induce him to plan the murder
of his brilliant and accomplished brother, whose
talents and advancement would surely contribute
to the progress of all the family. In that age,
although there were determined family feuds and
rivalries, there was frequently a strong sense of
family solidarity, and this the Borgias possessed
in an eminent degree.</p>

<p>Who was the unknown man in the mask who
had been coming to see Gandia at the Papal Palace
almost daily for a month past, and who had even
called on him during the supper in Vannozza’s
garden? Perhaps some pander or low associate
who had accompanied him during his debauches;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
or if not this, a decoy sent by some enemy of the
Duke or of his family—and Italy was teeming
with them.</p>

<p>If the murder was the work of some enemy, what
would be more natural than for the assassin to
endeavour to turn suspicion from himself and at the
same time heap infamy upon the Borgias by launching
the rumour that the Cardinal of Valencia was
the author of the crime?</p>

<p>It is clear that Gandia voluntarily went into the
quarter of the city dominated by the most determined
enemies of the Borgia—the Orsini. His personal
attendant was found in the morning murdered,
in the Piazza degli Ebrei, where the Duke had left
him. Evidently the man in the mask had led Gandia
into a trap, and then, after he had been dispatched,
had provided for the taking off of this henchman.
When Gandia left the servant he evidently thought
he might not return that evening.</p>

<p>But how could the man in the mask have visited
Gandia every day for a month for the purpose of
entrapping him, without the Duke discovering it
was a plot? Clearly Gandia had no suspicions
whatever.</p>

<p>The whole affair is so mysterious that we are
inclined to ask whether Burchard’s statement of
the circumstances is correct.</p>

<p>It is against all reason to suppose that Gandia
would have ventured at night unattended into the
quarter of the Orsini with a strange man behind
him on his mule, unless he was going to keep
an assignation, and his remark to Caesar shows
that such was his purpose.</p>

<p>If this assignation was only a plot to get him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
away from his own people, who contrived it? Did
Caesar? For Caesar to have arranged it right in
the stronghold of their bitterest enemies, a mass of
details, a planning, and a coincidence of events
wellnigh impossible would have been necessary. It
is much more logical to suppose that those enemies
themselves planned it—especially as Gandia had
been brought from Spain expressly to crush the
Orsini.</p>

<p>Again—we may ask—was the Duke playing false
with his own people? He had seen little of them,
he scarcely knew them. Did he perhaps fancy
that he might rise more rapidly by casting his
fortunes with the enemies of the Pope than by
supporting him? Was the mysterious man in the
mask the agent of some family or faction trying to
win over the Duke? Gandia accompanied this man
apparently without even a suggestion of fear
into the enemy’s quarter. If he was concerned
in some conspiracy against his family and the
Vatican, some obstacle in the negotiations may have
made his death and that of the bully left in the
square necessary to prevent exposure, even if it
had not at first been intended to murder the
Duke.</p>

<p>If he was plotting against the Vatican, who were
his fellow-conspirators in the Orsini quarter? The
affair seems to contain more than a mere assignation,
for if not why was it necessary to dispatch
the servant?</p>

<p>It was not long before accusations came from
without, started perhaps by persons who at a
distance felt secure from the wrath of the Borgia.</p>

<p>February 22, 1498, Pigna, the Ferrarese ambassador<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
in Venice, reported that he had heard that
Caesar had caused the Duke of Gandia’s death.
This was more than eight months after the crime;
it was the first time the charge had definitely been
made; several of the Orsini were then in Venice,
and they would undoubtedly have spread the
rumour, as the Pope had endeavoured to cast
suspicion on them. If they, however, had brought
about the Duke’s destruction, they would probably
have gloried in the deed.</p>

<p>The accusation once made against Caesar, it was
repeated by Paolo Capello in a relation of September
25, 1500, and also in the famous letter to
Silvio Savelli of November 15, 1501. This same
Capello, Venetian ambassador, wrote: “Every
night the bodies of four or five murdered men,
bishops, prelates, and so forth, are found in
Rome.” Under Alexander VI. crime held high
carnival in the Eternal City, as it had under his
predecessors.</p>

<p>The Pope did not receive Caesar—at least,
publicly—for five weeks, and the cardinal busied
himself with preparations for his journey to Naples
to crown the King.</p>

<p>His Holiness seemed to have changed; he was
constantly at work with the six cardinals he had
appointed to draw up plans for the reform of the
Church, and he declared in consistory that henceforth
family considerations and projects would have
no weight with him.</p>

<p>At last he gave up trying to discover the
murderer, and the conviction became general that
he, better than all others, knew who the guilty one
was. Alessandro Braccio, the Florentine orator in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
Rome, said in one of his dispatches: “Whoever
managed the affair had a good head, and courage—and
every one admits that he was a ‘master.’”
This peculiar attitude toward crime, which is
merely a form of the unreasoned and immoral
admiration for success regardless of means still
everywhere prevalent, was especially noticeable in
Italy during the Renaissance. Machiavelli well illustrates
it in his remarks on Giovanpagolo Baglioni
in connection with the expedition of Pope Julius II.
to Perugia in 1505, for the express purpose of
driving the Baglioni from their domain. Although
the Pope had a considerable army he entered the
city with only a small guard, in spite of the fact
that Giovanpagolo had a large force—and the
“prudent men who were with the Pope commented
on his rashness and on the cowardice of Giovanpagolo,
who might have won eternal glory and
at the same time have destroyed his enemy and
secured vast spoils, for the Pope was accompanied
by all the cardinals with their rich belongings. His
restraint was not due to any goodness or conscience,
for he was a man who, in order to reign, had murdered
many of his kinsmen; and it was concluded
that there are men who do not know how to be
great criminals or perfectly good—for a crime may
possess greatness and be to some extent glorious
[<i xml:lang="es" lang="es">generosa</i>]. Therefore Giovanpagolo did not know
how—or better, did not dare—when he had the
opportunity, to perform a deed for which every one
would have admired his courage and which would
have secured him eternal fame. And he would have
been the first to show the prelates how little respect
is due to those who live and reign as they do; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
he would have performed a deed whose greatness
would have wiped out all infamy.”<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a></p>

<p>The Vice-Chancellor’s palace near which Caesar
and Gandia parted on the night of June 14, 1497,
was on the Banchi Vecchi in the Ponte Quarter,
where the Orsini had four strongholds—Monte
Giordano, Torre di Nona, Tor Millina, and Tor
Sanguigna. Besides the Orsini and their retainers
a large number of Jews dwelt in this part of the
city.</p>

<p>June 16th Cardinal Ascanio Sforza sent his
brother, the Moor, an account of the tragedy, which
agrees closely with that of Burchard. He adds that
Gandia’s mule was found near the house of Carlo
da Parma. Burchard’s narrative agrees with all
those of the day. Many of the Romans made no
effort to conceal their joy at being rid of one Borgia,
and the satirists did not overlook the murder.</p>

<p>More than three years afterwards, September 28,
1500, the Venetian Ambassador, Paolo Capello,
definitely stated that Caesar was the murderer;
Capello, however, was not in Rome at the time of
the assassination.</p>

<p>It may never be known who was the murderer
of the Duke of Gandia, but there is absolutely no
proof that Caesar either instigated or planned the
assassination. Gandia was about to form an
alliance which the Pope believed—and Caesar must
have been of the same opinion—would materially
strengthen the house of Borgia, and the power of
the family had not yet become so firmly established
that Caesar would have been likely to commit a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
terrible crime for the purpose of securing the sole
dominion for himself. He still had need of Gandia,
whatever the future might bring him. There certainly
were numerous enemies of the Borgia who
would profit much more by the destruction of a
member of the family than Caesar could.</p>

<p>The kingdom of Naples was torn by discord;
one faction supported France, another Aragon; and
in his brief appointing the Cardinal of Valencia
legate to crown the King, the Pope enjoined him
to put an end to the strife. Caesar’s mission was
an important one.</p>

<p>Accompanied by a numerous retinue, the
expenses of which were to be borne by King
Frederic, the Cardinal of Valencia left Rome for
Naples, and August 1st reached Capua, where he
was received by the royal Court with the highest
honours. There he fell ill, and Giuffre and his wife,
Sancia, left Rome almost immediately to go to him.
However, his illness could not have been serious, for
he crowned Frederic, the last of the Aragonese
rulers of Naples, August 10, 1497.</p>

<p>Caesar acquitted himself well, displaying a
dignity beyond his years. He was invested with
special privileges for the occasion; the symbols of
the spiritual as well as of the temporal power—the
flabel, the sedia gestatoria, the globe, and the sword—were
borne before the Pope’s representative, who
exerted himself to secure the goodwill of the new
sovereign, who invested him, as the representative
of the son of the unfortunate Duke of Gandia, with
Benevento, the barony of Fiumara, and the county
of Montefoscolo.</p>

<p>August 22nd, to the great relief of Frederic,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
whose exchequer was suffering severely on account
of the entertainment, Caesar set out to return to
Rome; as he did not reach the city until the 5th
of the following month, he may have spent some
time inspecting the estates granted Gandia’s son
by the newly-crowned King.</p>

<p>The morning of the 6th—says Burchard—all the
cardinals who were in the city went to meet Caesar
at Santa Maria Nuova, and later all were received
by his Holiness, and the Master of Ceremonies
adds, “neither father nor son uttered a word, but
the Pope, having blessed him, descended from
the throne.” In this circumstance some writers
discover evidence of Caesar’s guilt.</p>

<p>The Pope, accompanied by the Cardinals of
Valencia and of Agrigentum, with an escort of a
thousand men, went to Ostia, October 17th, to
spend a few days. The large guard was made
necessary by the proximity of the Orsini. The
Pope and his family were in grave danger, and
now that Gandia was dead who was to defend them?
Giuffre was scarcely twenty, and he had cast his
fortunes with the House of Aragon; moreover, he
showed none of Caesar’s resoluteness.</p>

<p>At the coronation of the King of Naples the
legate had used a sword upon which was engraved
the motto <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Cum Numine Caesaris Amen</i> and
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Caesar Borgia Cardinalis Valentianus</i>, and which
is now in the possession of the Gaetani family of
Rome. All the engravings on the blade represent
scenes of war, and it is therefore reasonable to
assume that the cardinal’s dreams turned more to
military glory than to ecclesiastical honours, and
Gregorovius says, “the allusions to the Caesar of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
the Roman Empire show what ideas were already
seething in the cardinal’s brain.”</p>

<p>In November, 1497, the Spanish physician
Gaspare Torrella dedicated to the youthful cardinal
a work on a loathsome disease which had been
spread in Italy by the soldiers of Charles VIII.,
and which was in consequence called the “French
sickness.” Caesar himself evidently had suffered
from it, for the author states that the world owed
the cardinal a debt of gratitude for subjecting himself
to his treatment.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> A work by Sebastiano
Aquilano of Padua on the same subject was dedicated
to Ludovico Gonzaga, Bishop of Mantua.</p>

<p>February 14, 1498, the body of Pedro Calderon,
one of the Pope’s familiars, was found in the Tiber,
into which he had fallen, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">non libenter</i>, as Burchard
says, a few days before. In this connection the
Venetian ambassador, Capello, writes: “and
another time he [Caesar] murdered with his own
hand messer Pierotto, under the very mantle of
the Pope, so that the blood spurted up into the face
of his Holiness, of whom Pierotto was a favourite.”
This account agrees with that in the letter to Silvio
Savelli. Sanudo’s report of the affair is the same
as Burchard’s, but he adds that Pierotto was “found
drowned in the Tiber with a young woman called
Madona Panthasilea, one of Madonna Lucretia’s
young women and a creature of this pontiff’s—and
the cause is not known.” Early in the year 1498
it was rumoured in Rome that Caesar intended to
leave the Church. A letter written by Alexander
in August, 1497—less than two months after the
murder of the Duke of Gandia—shows that the Pope<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
was already considering a plan which implied this
step on his son’s part. Caesar now seldom
appeared in the garb of a cleric; he went everywhere
dressed in the “French style” and armed.
His tastes were altogether martial.</p>

<p>It appears that his Holiness was scheming for
Caesar to marry either the widow of King Ferdinand
of Naples or Doña Sancia, his sister-in-law,
who was to be separated from Giuffre for this purpose;
later the Prince of Squillace was to be made
a cardinal to replace his brother, in order that the
number of Spanish members of the Sacred College
be kept the same.</p>

<p>In this connection Sanudo says in his diary:
“Giuffre, younger than his wife, has not yet consummated
the marriage (he is not sixteen), he is
not a man, and according to what I have heard
Doña Sancia has for some months been the mistress
of the Cardinal of Valencia.” Fifteenth-century
chroniclers went into minute particulars.</p>

<p>Lucretia Borgia’s marriage with Giovanni Sforza
had been dissolved in spite of the husband’s
protests. For her the Pope was planning a more
brilliant future than the insignificant Lord of Pesaro
could offer and his Holiness readily found a pretext
for getting rid of him; in his project he was
assisted by both Ascanio Sforza and the Duke of
Milan. Although every one was against him,
Giovanni did not submit tamely, and he it was who
launched the charge of incest against the Pope
and Caesar and his own wife—a charge which,
whether true or false, has done more than anything
else to blacken their memory.</p>

<p>Lucretia’s formal divorce took place December<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
2, 1497. It had been brought about by the
Pope and Caesar purely for political reasons, and
it was now rumoured in Rome that she was to
marry Alfonso of Bisceglia, Sancia’s brother.</p>

<p>The Pope had asked King Frederic for the hand
of his daughter Carlotta for Caesar, but both he and
the princess absolutely refused. In his anxiety,
however, to escape the Pope’s wrath he made one
sacrifice and consented to the marriage of Lucretia
and Don Alfonso, Sancia’s younger brother. This
youth of seventeen came to Rome unattended by
any pomp and the betrothal took place in the
Vatican June 20, 1498, and the marriage the 21st
of the following month. Lucretia was about a year
older than her husband.</p>

Giuliano della Rovere—Louis XII. and Caesar meet—Caesar’s

<p class="in0"><span class="pfirst">Charles VIII.</span> died April 7, 1498, and was
succeeded by Louis XII., who was endeavouring
to secure from the Pope the necessary dispensation
to enable him to repudiate his wife Jeanne and
marry his predecessor’s widow, Queen Anne, whose
dowry would include the Duchy of Bretagne.</p>

<p>The Pope, with his usual clairvoyance with
respect to his personal interests, immediately saw
an opportunity to profit by the circumstances, and
he made a bargain by which, in return for his
dispensation, the King agreed to bestow the county
of Valence—which was to be raised to a duchy—upon
Caesar, who was to renounce his cardinalate.
The King also promised to find him a princess for
wife. The Cardinal of Valencia was thus to become
the Duke of Valentinois. The King also agreed
to give him a pension of twenty thousand livres—a
great sum for those days—and also to maintain
a company of one hundred men-at-arms for him.
The bargain also included a cardinal’s hat for the
King’s Prime Minister, Georges d’Amboise, Bishop
of Rouen, who was always careful not to overlook
his own interests.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
In addition the Pope and the King entered into
an alliance, offensive and defensive, the Holy
Father agreeing to assist the King in the conquest
of the Regno, and Louis promising to aid Alexander
to reduce the rebellious lords in the Romagna and
to re-establish the integrity of the Papal domain.
Thus did sovereigns play fast and loose with human
destinies. This vast intrigue developed during
the first eight months of the year 1498; and
August 17th, in a secret consistory, Caesar asked
for a special dispensation to enable him to resign
his ecclesiastical offices and again become a layman
in order that he might marry. On the Pope’s
promise that all the offices and benefices his son
had enjoyed should revert to the Sacred College,
the cardinals promptly consented to the dispensation.
The same day Louis de Villeneuve, Baron
of Trans, representing Louis XII., arrived in Rome
for the purpose of escorting Caesar to France.</p>

<p>Sure of the cardinals’ consent, everything had
been arranged in advance for Caesar’s departure,
even those who were to accompany him had been
selected. His gorgeous wardrobe, which set all
Rome to talking, had been prepared. The Baron
of Trans had brought the patents of Caesar’s new
domain, and, accompanied by a numerous retinue,
they set out for Ostia October 1st “for the purpose
of going to France by sea, and,” Burchard adds,
“I heard that he had a vast amount of money<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
with him and that several of his horses were shod
with silver.” The new Duke took with him
200,000 gold ducats, confiscated shortly before
from Pedro de Aranda, Bishop of Calahorra, who
had recently—most opportunely—been convicted on
the charge of heresy—Alexander VI. always endeavoured
to pluck his victims and compass his
iniquities strictly in accordance with the forms of
law. Three hundred Jews and usurers, found guilty
of various offences, had been imprisoned, but their
terms were commuted into heavy fines, the money
going to swell Caesar’s exchequer.</p>

<p>Louis XII. had promised to send a fleet of
several vessels to Ostia to conduct him to France,
and it was expected about the end of August, but
it did not arrive until October 27th, when the new
Duke embarked with a hundred pages, servants,
equerries, and retainers. Besides his horses he
had fifty mules and wagons to carry his personal
effects.</p>

<p>In his suite were his secretary, Agapito, the
famous Spanish physician, Gaspare Torrella, and
his majordomo, Remiro de Lorca, whom he subsequently
had beheaded in Cesena for fraudulent
and oppressive acts as governor of that place.</p>

<p>Six days were required to make the voyage to
Marseilles, where Caesar was received upon the
quay by the Archbishop of Dijon. Thence they
went to Avignon, where the Duke met Giuliano
della Rovere, the implacable enemy of his family,
who was compelled in consequence of his quarrel
with them to live abroad, and who was then residing
at the Court of France, although since August,
when Ostia had been restored to the cardinal, they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
had been on somewhat better terms. A month
before Caesar’s departure for Marseilles the Pope
had written the Cardinal San Pietro ad Vincola
recommending Caesar to him, and Della Rovere
had replied in the friendliest manner. In one of
his letters to the Pope he said: “I cannot refrain
from telling you that the Duke of Valence is so
modest, sensible, and capable, and endowed with
such fine qualities, both mental and physical, that
every one is charmed by him. He is in high favour
at Court and with the King. All love and esteem
him; it gives me real pleasure to say this.”</p>

<p>In cunning and duplicity Della Rovere was a
match for Borgia, and he was waiting for a more
favourable opportunity to destroy his enemy.</p>

<p>From Avignon Caesar went to Valence, the
capital of his duchy, but he declined to accept
the honours which were offered him until he was
formally placed in possession of his State. Almost
immediately on his arrival there a royal messenger
appeared and in the King’s name presented him
with the Order of St. Michael—an honour at that
time reserved for princes of the blood and the
great nobles of the kingdom—but Caesar declared
he would accept it only from the hands of the
sovereign.</p>

<p>Benoit Maillard, Prior of the Abbey of Savigny,
records Caesar’s arrival in Lyons in November
“with great magnificence in his apparel and
trappings.” The 7th of the month an extraordinary
banquet was given for Valentinois, and the
account of the expenditures throws a curious
light on the manners of the day. The list of viands
is astonishing: 28 capons, 168 white partridges,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
24 red ones, 192 ducks, 420 turtle-doves, 36 wood-cock,
144 peafowl, 120 pheasants, a round of veal,
a quarter of beef, 150 pounds of lard, oranges,
vanilla, 2 <em>goneaux</em>, 18 quince pies, 18 English
tarts, 18 <em>bride faveaulx</em>, 18 platters of minced meat
fritters, 18 platters of <em>foub</em>, 18 platters of lambs’
tongues in aspic, 18 platters of <em>mestier</em>, 18 <em>pâtés</em>
of capon, 18 <em>pâtés</em> of lark, 18 cream cakes,
almonds, eggs, rose-water, suet, quantities of
cinnamon, candied orange-peel, annis, <em>pignons</em>,
colliander-seed, <em>mandrians</em>, sugar-plums seasoned
with musk, hippocras, ginger, nutmegs, cloves,
sugar, malmsey, muscat, grapes, plums, dates,
pomegranates, &amp;c.—truly a gargantuan feast.</p>

<p>Caesar finally met the King at Chinon, December
18th. Louis did not wish to treat Caesar as
the son of a sovereign, but at the same time did
not want to incur the Pope’s enmity by offending
him; he therefore hit upon the ingenious expedient
of meeting Caesar by chance—under pretext of
going to the chase—about two leagues from the
city gates. There he greeted him warmly, even
treating him familiarly, but did not accompany him
to the city, where he was met by the Cardinal
of Rouen and a brilliant escort representing
the King.</p>

<p>Brantôme gives a detailed account of Caesar’s
entry into Chinon.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> The Sieur de Bourdeille says
he found the account among his family papers
written in rather crude verse, and that he rewrote
it in prose—<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">au plus clair et net langage</i>.</p>

<p>“First came M. the Cardinal of Rouen, M. de<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
Ravastain, M. the Seneschal of Toulouse, and M.
de Clermont, who together with many lords and
gentlemen of the court accompanied the Duke on
his entry as far as the end of the bridge. Then
there were eighty-four very beautiful mules laden
with trunks and chests covered with red cloth with
the arms and escutcheon of the said Duke. Then
came twenty-four more mules with trappings of
red and yellow, the livery of the King, for these
were his colours; then followed twelve mules
covered with striped yellow satin. Then came ten
mules covered with cloth of gold in stripes, first
one smooth and then one wavy.</p>

<p>“When all had passed the bridge they went to
the castle.</p>

<p>“Then came sixteen magnificent coursers covered
with red and yellow cloth of gold, each led by a
groom, and with Turkish bridles. These were
followed by eighteen pages each mounted on a
handsome steed, and sixteen of them were clad in
crimson velvet and the other two in crinkled cloth
of gold. Then followed six lackeys, according to
the custom of the day, leading six beautiful mules
harnessed and with saddle and bridle, and with
trappings of crimson velvet, and the lackeys were
clothed with the same.</p>

<p>“Then came two mules bearing coffers on their
backs and all were covered with cloth of gold—and
the people in the crowd said that these contained
something more exquisite than all the others—rich
and precious stones for his mistress, and for others—perhaps
some bulls and fine indulgences from
Rome, or perhaps some holy relics, said others.
Then came thirty gentlemen clothed in cloth of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
gold and silver—but there were not enough of these,
said the Court; in view of the large number that
had preceded them there should have been at least
a hundred, or a hundred and twenty clad in the
French or Danish fashion.</p>

<p>“Then followed three musicians, two small
drums and a violin—which were at this time in great
favour—just as the great lords of Germany and
generals of armies now have them when on the
march. The two drummers above mentioned were
clad in cloth of gold and their instruments were of
silver and were provided with great chains of gold
and the said musicians went before the gentlemen
named above and the Duke of Valentinois, playing
their instruments the while.</p>

<p>“Then came four trumpets or clarions of silver,
the musicians being richly dressed and playing continually.
These were followed by eighty lackeys
clad in crimson velvet and yellow silk, who surrounded
the Duke and M. the Cardinal of Rouen,
who was conversing with him.</p>

<p>“As to the Duke himself he was mounted upon
a magnificent charger richly accoutred with a robe
of red satin and cloth of gold, with a border of
precious stones and pearls.</p>

<p>“On his bonnet were five or six rubies as large
as beans which flashed most brilliantly; on his
cuffs were great quantities of precious stones and
even his boots were covered with gold and gems.</p>

<p>“The horse which he rode was covered with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
gold and jewels with pearls and precious stones
galore.</p>

<p>“In addition he had a beautiful little mule to
ride about the city; and its harness, saddle, bridle,
and brest band were covered with rosettes of fine
gold as thick as one’s finger.</p>

<p>“Bringing up the rear there were eighty mules
more, with red trappings and the arms of the said
Duke and also a great number of wagons laden
with other necessities such as camp beds, utensils,

<p>“The King was at a window watching his arrival
and there is no doubt that he and his courtiers
made merry over him and said that it was too
much for a little Duke of Valence.”</p>

<p>The château of Chinon had been selected for
the Duke’s residence and there the King, accompanied
by Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere, called
upon him. When the Duke was about to kneel the
King restrained him; a few words were exchanged
and then the Cardinal of Rouen informed his
Majesty that Monseigneur, the Duke, had not yet
dined, whereupon the King replied: “Very well,
then let his Highness go to dinner”—thus ending
the interview; Louis evidently was bored and not
greatly impressed. After dinner the King received
Caesar and the following day they took a walk
together. A few days later the King went to Nantes
to meet the Queen and the marriage was celebrated.
Caesar’s fopperies and extravagance in dress caused
general amusement and disgust and the King and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
his courtiers ridiculed the “vain glory and stupid
pomposity of this little duke of Valentinois.” Louis,
however, wished to use Caesar in his schemes, consequently
he was careful not to offend him.</p>

<p>The Duke had brought the King a letter from the
Pope in which he said: “In order that your Majesty
may see how great is our desire to please you in
all things we are sending you our heart, that is
our beloved son, the Duke of Valentinois, and we
beseech your Majesty to treat him in such a way
that all may know how dear this Caesar, whom
I entrust to your kingly good faith, has become to
you in all ways.”</p>

<p>Thus far but one of the articles of the agreement
between the Pope and the King had been carried
out. By letters patent, dated August 13, 1498,
Caesar had been created Duke of Valentinois and
he had been received as such at the Court of
France. The negotiations, however, which were
intended eventually to make him the heir to a
crown had failed. Louis had undertaken to secure
the marriage of Caesar and Carlotta of Aragon,
daughter of the King of Naples, but Frederic
opposed it and the young woman herself absolutely
refused to consent to the union.</p>

<p>The brilliant entry into Chinon therefore was a
fiasco, as Giuliano della Rovere, in a letter dated
January 18, 1499, informed the Pope, who shortly
after complained to the cardinal that the King
had exposed him to ridicule, as it was known everywhere
that Caesar had gone to France expressly
to marry.</p>

<p>Caesar, however, had displayed the astuteness
and cunning that never deserted him, for when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
obstacles began to be interposed in the way of
marrying Carlotta he pretended that he did not
have the dispensation permitting Louis XII. to
marry Anne of Bretagne.</p>

<p>The King, however, had been informed by the
Pope himself that the dispensation had been
granted, consequently he had proceeded with his
plans and the decree of divorce had been obtained.</p>

<p>The political interests of the King of France in
Italy were, however, more important than the purely
personal question of his marriage with the widow
of Charles VIII.; consequently it was greatly to
his interest to find some way to gratify the Pope’s
wishes, therefore he made another effort to overcome
the opposition of Frederic and his daughter,
but in vain. Louis thereupon decided to substitute
his own niece, the daughter of the Count de Foix,
but she, too, declined.</p>

<p>Caesar, however, treated the matter in a cavalier
manner, saying that if the King of Naples would
have none of him because he was a natural son,
Frederic himself was also illegitimate, merely a
king’s bastard, while he himself—and he was proud
of it—was the bastard of a pope!</p>

<p>Among the demoiselles who had come from
various parts of France to acquire the graces of
the polished Court of the Queen was Charlotte
d’Albret, sister of Jean d’Albret, King of Navarre,
and daughter of Alain, Duke of Guyenne. While
Charlotte was still a child she had been placed
under the care of Anne of Bretagne, and she had
grown into a beautiful young woman, gracious and
intelligent, and Louis decided to endeavour to bring
about a union between her and Caesar. Alain,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
the father, looked with little favour upon the proposed
marriage, but the political interests of the
House of Navarre were such that he decided to
consent, provided, of course, he could drive a good
bargain—for in the days of chivalry fair women
were exceedingly valuable pieces in the great
game of politics. Throughout the negotiations
Charlotte’s father showed himself to be cold,
calculating, avaricious, and suspicious, but as Louis
felt that everything depended upon securing a wife
for Caesar, and as he himself was anxious to set
out for Italy he granted all of Alain’s demands.
The negotiations were protracted, almost interminable,
but finally the marriage contract was drawn
up at the château of Blois, May 10, 1499, in the
presence of the King, Queen Anne, the Cardinal
d’Amboise, Chancellor of France, the Archbishop
of Sens, the proxies of the Duke of Guyenne, and
numerous other dignitaries. By its terms Alain
d’Albret was to give his daughter a dowry of
30,000 livres Tournois. The marriage was celebrated
May 12, 1499, and the bride was said to
be the most beautiful woman of France, while
Caesar was described as possessing fine features
and a most elegant bearing; one writer said that,
like the Emperor Tiberius, he was the handsomest
man of his century. Charlotte d’Albret must have
known that the marriage was purely a political
one. Burchard records that May 23rd a courier
arrived from France with a letter to the Pope from
Caesar in which he made a brutal confession with
regard to his wife.</p>

<p>Charlotte wrote the Pope expressing filial devotion
and a desire to come to Rome to make his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
acquaintance—and she added that she was very
much pleased with her new spouse.</p>

<p>Alain’s daughter was the sacrifice and Alexander
VI. and Louis XII. were to reap the benefits.
Among the documents containing the negotiations
with Alain d’Albret are some which clearly reveal
their plans.</p>

<p>The treaty made by the Pope and the King has
often been published; but the one under discussion
when they were endeavouring to bring about
a marriage between Caesar and King Frederic’s
daughter had never been printed until M. Yriarte
reproduced<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> the entire document as an example
of the duplicity which then marked all political
transactions—and, it might be added, which continues
to characterise them.</p>

<p>“Minutes of an agreement between our Holy
Father, the Pope Alexander VI. and the Most
Christian <span class="locked">King:—</span></p>

<p>“1. In order that the Pope may appreciate the
love which the King bears toward him and his,
the said lord promises His Holiness to marry Mgr.
de Valence to the eldest daughter of Don Frederic,
with her express consent, the said daughter being
with the queen.</p>

<p>“2. In order that the said seigneur of Valence
may have the necessary means for maintaining his
proper estate the King will give him, for himself
and his heirs in perpetuity, the county of Valence
and Diois which is estimated to be worth twenty
thousand francs a year; and in case it should not
prove to be worth the sum named the King will
furnish him from some other source enough to make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
up the said sum, and as the brothers of the said
sieur de Valence are dukes and princes the King will
raise the said county into a duchy.</p>

<p>“3. He will give to the said seigneur de Valence
one hundred lances, maintained by France, both
in time of war and in peace, for carrying on his
projects in Italy and elsewhere. The King will
increase this number with two or three hundred
lances whenever it should seem to him to be for
the best.</p>

<p>“4. He will give the said seigneur de Valence an
annual pension of twenty thousand francs for his
personal expenses.</p>

<p>“5. In case that the said King recovers his
duchy of Milan he will give the said seigneur de
Valence his county of Asti for him and his, to hold
under the King in loyalty and homage.</p>

<p>“Item. He will give the said seigneur de Valence
his order of St. Michael; and in order that the King
may be satisfied of the good will of our Holy Father,
His Holiness will place the said Sieur de Valence
in his service and will have him marry the person
selected. To conduct the affair more secretly and
surely the King will, by the middle of August, place
six vessels in order in the port of Ciotat, Bishopric
of Aix, to bring the said Sieur de Valence and the
legate whom the Pope shall select to perform
the requirements of the King. Item because
... runs danger by the absence of Mgr. de
Valence the King will send the Pope a thousand
men for his guard during his absence for
which the King will pay each month four thousand
ducats which shall be paid the Pope secretly
by Mgr. the Cardinal of St. Denis, who is in Rome,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
and this engagement shall be for three or four
months.</p>

<p>“And in case the Holy Father should feel that
this confederation and agreement of perpetual
friendship was endangered by any prince of the
league the King will give him letters patent signed
with his hand and sealed with his seal by which
he will promise and swear to God and the Virgin
Mary to defend, guard, and protect His Holiness
in temporal as well as spiritual affairs.</p>

<p>“Item. Regarding the kingdom of Naples
whatever the King may do, the said seigneur
promises to do nothing and determine upon nothing
except by the hand of His Holiness.</p>

<p>“Item. He will have our seigneurs the Cardinals
ad Vincula and Gurk return to Rome and the
Pope agrees to treat them with all friendliness and
gentleness as his good brothers, of which the King
shall assure them, at the same time exhorting them
to obey and respect our Holy Father.</p>

<p>“All of which the King promises on his word as
King to maintain, observe, and keep, and in whatever
concerns the estate of Mgr. de Valence regarding
the said counties he will have the same ratified
and agreed to by the chamber of accounts.</p>

<p>“And so far as the other articles are concerned
the King will give the Bishop of Cette and the
Archdeacon of Chalais such private letters as the
Pope may wish and which will be sent with the
memorandum, &amp;c., &amp;c.”</p>

<p>When news reached Rome that Caesar had
received the coveted order of St. Michael from
the King there was a great celebration in the city
and bonfires were lighted by order of the Pope<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
before the palaces of Cardinals Orsini and St.
Dionysius and also before that of Lucretia; the
evening of May 23rd the Spaniards indulged in
an orgy which Burchard says was a disgrace to
the Pope and the Holy See.</p>

<p>From the secret agreement it is clear that the
conquest of Milan and the expedition against
Naples had been decided upon. The King of
France, now sure of the Pope and Caesar, signed
a treaty of alliance, both offensive and defensive,
with Venice April 15, 1499, which was directed
against all the Italian princes. The negotiations
had been kept secret from Ludovico il Moro; that
prince <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">sans foi et sans loi</i>, whose destruction was
determined upon, was the last to learn of it. The
price the Venetians demanded for joining the
league was the cities of Cremona and Chiari.
Although the Duke of Savoy was in accord with
Louis XII. he did not formally join the alliance.</p>

<p>Ludovico il Moro was the most hated man in
Italy: he had betrayed Florence, Venice, and the
King of France one after the other; without regard
to the other powers of Italy he had treated with
Charles VIII. when the French first descended into
the peninsula. Consequently when he was again
threatened he found himself without friend or ally.</p>

<p>Louis’s pretensions to Milan were based, not only
on his inheritance of the rights of Charles VIII.
but also on the claims of his grandmother, Valentina
Visconti, and as he was also determined to recover
Naples he was wise in securing a strong place in the
north. Before attempting the conquest of Milan
Louis renewed the treaties of Charles VIII. with
his neighbours. The Duke of Savoy gave him permission
to pass through his territory and promised
him troops; in return for Venice’s assistance Louis
agreed to give her the two places she had demanded;
the Pope and Caesar had already been
paid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
The King dispatched his armies to Italy under
the command of Louis de Ligny and the Count
d’Aubigny but did not immediately go himself.</p>

<p>Ludovico il Moro was attacked simultaneously
by the French and the Venetians, and as his own
people hated him and his governors proved false,
he lost all his cities one by one and was reduced
to the last extremity and finally compelled to make
his escape to Germany. When the Gascon archers
entered Milan, October 2, 1499, they shot his statue—the
work of Leonardo da Vinci—to pieces with
their arrows.</p>

<p>Caesar was still in France but was preparing to
come to Italy; before leaving he gave his wife
a power of attorney to enable her to act as administrator
of his new possessions, the Duchy of
Valentinois, the County of Diois, and all his
seignories and property in the Kingdom of France,
and in Dauphiné.</p>

<p>Valentinois had lived with his wife from the last
of April until September, and early in 1500
Charlotte bore him a daughter, who was christened
Louise and who was destined never to know her
father. The Duchess of Valentinois never saw
Caesar again.</p>

<p>Valentino may have returned to Italy with the
King of France, for the chronicler Jean d’Auton
records that the Duke was among the great lords
who accompanied Louis XII. when he entered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
Milan, Sunday, October 6, 1499.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> The cardinals
Delia Rovere and Amboise were also present, together
with the dukes of Savoy and Ferrara, the
Marquis of Mantua, the ambassadors of Genoa,
Florence, Pisa, Siena, and Bologna, and innumerable
other high dignitaries. Baldessare Castiglione,
who accompanied the Marquis of Mantua, describes
Valentinois as <i xml:lang="it" lang="it">molte galante</i>. A month later when
Louis XII. set out to return to France, having left
the government of the conquered duchy to Trivulzio,
he directed two of his captains, Yves d’Allegre and
the Bailli of Dijon to place themselves under
Valentino’s orders. The former had a company of
three hundred lances and the latter four thousand
Swiss and Gascons, while Caesar himself had
collected a considerable number of men.</p>

<p class="in0"><span class="pfirst">The</span> campaign in Romagna had been decided
upon and Caesar found himself at the head of a
thoroughly disciplined and well-equipped force of
about sixteen thousand men who were held in camp
at Cesena.</p>

<p>Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere, whose brother
was assured Sinigaglia by the betrothal of his
nephew, Francesco, with Angela Borgia, abandoned
his kinsmen, the Riario, to their destruction. In
a letter dated October 12, 1499, the cardinal
thanked the Pope for the proposed marriage and
promised to look after Valentino’s interests with the
King of France.</p>

<p>November 9th the army broke camp, Caesar
taking the cavalry to Piacenza, whence, accompanied
by the Bishop of Tulle and a single servant,
he came quietly to Rome and remained at the
Vatican with the Pope until the 24th, when he
rejoined his troops and set out for Imola.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
Girolamo Riario’s wife, Caterina Sforza, had been
given Imola as part of her dowry and, her husband
having died in 1488, she acted as regent for her
son Ottaviano. Of Caterina Sforza Gregorovius
says: “The grandchild of the great Francesco
Sforza of Milan, natural daughter of Galeazzo Maria
and sister of Bianca, wife of the Emperor Maximilian,
she was the ideal of the heroic women of
Italy who were found not merely in the poems of
Bojardo and Ariosto but also in real life. To
understand the evolution of such personalities, in
whom beauty and culture, courage and reason,
sensuality and cruelty combined to produce a
singular organisation, we must be familiar with
the conditions from which they sprang—Caterina
Sforza’s experiences made her the amazon that she
was.”</p>

<p>Shortly after her marriage to the untutored
nephew of Sixtus IV., Girolamo Riario, Count of
Forli, her father met a tyrant’s death in Milan.
Subsequently her husband was stabbed to death
and his naked body flung from the walls of the
castle of Forli by conspirators. Caterina, however,
ferociously avenged the murder of her husband
and succeeded in holding his estates for her children.
Six years later her brother, Gian Galeazzo,
died of poison administered by Ludovico il Moro.
Finally her second husband, Giacomo Feo of
Savona, was slain by conspirators in Forli, and the
heroic Caterina mounted her charger and with a
small body of men pursued them to their lair and
put them all to the sword, with their women and
children—thus she deserved Sanudo’s description,
“a courageous woman and most cruel virago.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
She ruled her little domain with force and cunning;
and later, when she fell into Caesar’s clutches,
few lamented her fate and Giangiacomo Trivulzio
cynically remarked: “She has now fallen into the
hands of two men who can satisfy all her desires.”</p>

<p>She was a woman of heroic character, such as
the Renaissance described as a virago, a term expressive
of admiration, not reproach. The virago
corresponded to the man who possessed what the
Italian called <i xml:lang="it" lang="it">virtu</i>, which has nothing to do with
virtue, but which comprises energy, intellect, will,
the sum total of attributes which enabled a man
successfully to cope with his adversaries—in brief,
the qualities most dear to the Italian heart of the
fifteenth century.</p>

<p>When the Pope had declared that the lords of
the Romagna, having failed to pay the annual
tribute to the Holy See, were deprived of their
possessions, Caterina Sforza set up the claim that
the Holy See still owed her a large sum of money
which had been due her husband as Captain of
the pontifical army; she therefore announced that
if they persisted she would resist, and her first
move was to send her younger children and her
jewels to Florence for safety.</p>

<p>Knowing in advance that her people, because of
their hatred of the Riario, would betray her, she
retired to the castle of Forli and, filling it with arms
and munitions of war, calmly awaited the enemy.</p>

<p>When Caesar was still some distance from the
city, delegates appeared in his camp and offered
to surrender the town to him without resistance.
The capitulation was signed November 26th and
Valentino entered the city the following day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
The castle independently of the town was
defended by Dionigi di Naldo, whose wife and
children were held by Caterina Sforza as hostages
in the stronghold of Forli. Naldo held out for some
time, but was finally forced to surrender, and
December 13, 1499, Cardinal Giovanni Borgia,
legate for Romagna and Bologna, received the oath
of fidelity to the Holy See, in the Church of S.
Domenico in Imola.</p>

<p>The smaller places in the county of Imola having
been captured without difficulty, Valentino advanced
against Forli, December 15th. On learning of
Caesar’s approach, Caterina, who had retired to the
castle, dispatched her brother, Alessandro Sforza,
to urge the citizens to resist, saying that she herself
would fight to the last. They, however, refused,
and she took advantage of the last moments to send
her eldest son to Florence for safety. The citizens
were determined to surrender, and they so informed
both the Countess and Valentinois. The two commissioners—who
never returned—had scarcely
delivered their message when she directed her
artillery on the city and partly demolished the
town hall.</p>

<p>Caesar arrived before the gates of Forli December
17th, but refused to enter as conqueror until the
articles of capitulation had been given him. Two
days later he made his entry without opposition,
the citizens preferring him to their lord, Girolamo
Riario, who had burdened them with heavy taxes
and administered the laws in the most partial
manner.</p>

<p>The castle still held out and Caesar immediately
began preparations for its capture. On Christmas<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
Day Caterina raised the flag of Venice, the lion of
St. Mark, to make the enemy believe that the
republic was her ally, but Caesar was not deceived.</p>

<p>After attempting to make a breach, Valentino
decided to try to effect an agreement of some sort,
and for this purpose presented himself before the
walls, where the Countess herself talked to him
from the ramparts; but she refused all offers;
the Duke made two other equally unsuccessful
attempts, and did not open fire until December 28th.</p>

<p>The Countess succeeded in repelling all his
attacks until January 12, 1500. She was everywhere
on the ramparts encouraging and directing
her men. When the outer walls were stormed,
Caterina, before retiring to the keep—the last resort—ordered
all the supplies to be set on fire, thinking
thereby to compel the enemy to retreat, but it was
too late, for Yves d’Allegre and his French company
succeeded in forcing their way into the tower, and
a Bourguignon, in searching the halls, found the
heroic Countess of Forli surrounded by a band of
her faithful people. Eager for the reward of twenty
thousand ducats which had been offered for her
capture alive, he declared her his prisoner.</p>

<p>That same evening the Countess left the fortress
with the honours of war; she rode forth, mounted
on her charger, between the Duke of Valentinois
and Yves d’Allegre, who conducted her and her
maids to the palace of the Numai.</p>

<p>Immediately after the capture of Forli, Caesar
dispatched Yves d’Allegre to secure the surrender
of the remaining small towns, while he devoted
himself to reorganising the government of the conquered
territory. His solicitude for the proper<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
administration of justice and the prompt restoration
of order at once won him the respect of the
Romagnols, and from Imola and Forli envoys were
sent to ask the Pope to appoint Caesar—who had
declared himself to be merely the representative
of the Holy See—their Governor in place of the
tyrant he had expelled.</p>

<p>Caesar signed his first decree: “Caesar Borgia
De France, Duke of Valentinois, Count of Diois
and Issoudun, Pontifical Vicar of Imola and Forli,”
and at the head of the province he placed Don
Remiro de Lorca, the Spaniard who had been his
constant companion, and whom we shall meet
again.</p>

<p>After the capture of Imola, Cardinal Giovanni
Borgia, papal legate to Romagna, had gone to
Urbino, where he suddenly died, January 14, 1500.
In spite of the fact that seventeen days had intervened
between his departure from Caesar’s camp
and his death, it was rumoured that Valentino,
actuated by jealousy, had poisoned him. Sanudo
was the first to attribute the Cardinal’s death to
Caesar, but—as in the case of the murder of the
Duke of Gandia—there is not the slightest evidence
that he had anything to do with it. The Cardinal
had been in Rome, and on his way to Urbino
had been seized with a fever from which he
died.</p>

<p>Caesar readily consented that all the benefices
of the deceased should be given to his brother,
Ludovico, who was made Governor of Spoleto.</p>

<p>The general hatred of the Borgia explains the
facility with which these rumours spread and the
universal credence they obtained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
January 24th it was decided to set out for Pesaro
the following day; but in the night the Swiss
mutinied, and the Bailli of Dijon went to the castle
where Caterina Sforza was held, and, declaring that
it was contrary to the rules of war to hold a woman
prisoner, and that his sense of honour was outraged,
escorted her to the palace where he lodged
and refused to surrender her to Valentino, who
intended to take her to Rome and deliver her to
the Pope.</p>

<p>The revolt lasted a day, and Yves d’Allegre,
having been hastily summoned by Caesar, returned
in the evening, and Valentino, now sure of being
able to repress the rebels with the aid of the French
and the Spaniards, addressed the mutineers and
threatened them with dire punishment. It was
finally agreed that the bailli should surrender the
Countess, “who shall be retained in the discretion
of the King of France,” and an understanding with
the Swiss mercenaries was reached.</p>

<p>The evening of January 25th the army set out
for Cesena, Caterina Sforza, in a black satin gown
and heavily veiled, riding between the Duke of
Valentinois and Monsieur d’Allegre.</p>

<p>At Montefiore, January 26th, news reached
Caesar that Ludovico il Moro, who had fled from
Milan, had learned of the dissatisfaction of the
people under French rule, and, having gathered
an army of 1,300 Swiss and Bourguignons, was
advancing on Como. Trivulzio, who had been left
in charge of Milan, hastily sent for Yves d’Allegre,
whose withdrawal from Caesar’s army terminated
operations in the Romagna for a time, as it deprived
Valentino of his artillery, and left him with only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
about five hundred cavalry and a thousand foot-soldiers.</p>

<p>In Milan the French were defeated as easily as
they had conquered, and the people displayed the
same enthusiasm on the return of the Moor as they
had shown on his overthrow.</p>

<p>Caesar had left a small force to hold each of the
towns he had captured in Romagna, and he had
placed five hundred horse, under the command of
Ercole Bentivoglio, conveniently situated to go to
the aid of any garrison that might be threatened.</p>

<p>Valentino, having with him the Countess of Forli,
who had again been placed in his charge on the
departure of Yves d’Allegre for Milan, set out
January 30th with five hundred horse, and passing
through Fano, Urbino, and Spoleto, arrived in
Rome February 26, 1500.</p>

<p>The Pope evidently wished to make the entrance
of the Duke of Valentinois—returning from his
victorious campaign in the Romagna—into the
Eternal City as imposing as possible, for he instructed
all the Church dignitaries then in Rome
to meet the illustrious Caesar, with their suites.
Several of the cardinals had already gone to greet
him at some distance from the city, and now the
orators of the various powers, the abbreviators of
the Roman Curia, and the secretaries rode forth to
welcome him. The Duke entered the city late in
the afternoon, and was met near the Church of Sta
Maria del Popolo by the Church dignitaries.</p>

<p>First came a train of wagons laden with chests
filled with the Duke’s personal effects; then there
were a thousand of his foot-soldiers, Swiss and
Gascons; these were followed by a papal escort<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
of lancers, with the flag of St. Andrew. Caesar
followed, riding between Cardinal Orsini and Cardinal
Farnese, who had gone forth to meet him.
They were accompanied by a bodyguard of a
hundred men clad in black velvet. Caesar wore a
black velvet cloak reaching down to his knees.
Just behind him were several flute-players wearing
his arms, and then came two heralds of his own
and one of the King of France. After them were
the Duke of Bisceglia on the right and the Prince
of Squillace on the left; then the Archbishop of
Ragusa on the right and the Bishop of Treguier on
the left of the orator of the King of France; then
came the Bishop of Zamora and the orator of Spain,
who were followed by the two ambassadors of
Navarre, who engaged in an altercation with the
orators of Naples and England regarding the question
of precedence—the former lost and dropped
out of the procession in a tiff. Then came the
envoys of Venice, Florence, and Savoy, who were
followed by a great rabble, who crowded and
pushed so rudely that the prelates were unable
to secure their proper places.</p>

<p>The Pope had taken up his position in a room
above the entrance to the palace, and with him were
the Cardinals of Monreale, Alessandria and Capua,
together with Cesarini and Farnese.</p>

<p>When the Duke reached the Vatican the Pope
went to the Chamber of the Papagalli with
several cardinals, and when the doors were
thrown open Caesar and a great swarm of
nobles and prelates entered. Valentino advanced,
and kneeling before the Holy Father, addressed
him briefly in Spanish, thanking him for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
honours he had conferred upon him. The Pope
replied in the same tongue, “which I did not
understand,” says Burchard. Thereupon the Duke
kissed the Pope’s feet and right hand, and his
Holiness kissed his son on the lips. Then such
of the nobles who desired to do so kissed the
Pontiff’s feet. Sanudo says the Holy Father was
so overjoyed at the return of his son, that he
laughed and wept at one and the same time, and
that he would not grant any audiences that day.</p>

<p>The Master of Ceremonies describes the decorations
of the Castle of St. Angelo and the pageants
and festivities at great length, and “never before
had I beheld such extravagance and display,” he
concludes. February 27th, the day after Valentino’s
arrival, there was a magnificent pageant representing
the “Triumph of Julius Caesar,” in which
there were eleven cars, the last bearing the Roman
Emperor. The procession went to the palace, where
the car of Julius Caesar was left, whence some
writers have concluded that Valentino took the part
of the Emperor. Burchard says that Caesar rode
on horseback from the palace to the Agona quarter,
where the festivities of the citizens were held
according to their custom. The games, which
included races of horses, asses, bulls, buffaloes,
lasted until March 5th, when Caesar began
to pay his calls on the cardinals. He went
unaccompanied by any of the Church dignitaries,
but had with him a few of his officers and a
military escort of a hundred men clad in black
velvet. He displayed his usual tact, and surprised
the cardinals by always allowing them the place
of precedence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
Caesar had brought his prisoner, Caterina Sforza,
to Rome, but the story that he compelled her to
grace his triumphal entry into the Eternal City is
undoubtedly false, because, had he done so,
Burchard, who chronicles the most insignificant
details regarding his entry, would certainly have
mentioned her, and he does not refer to the Countess.
The stories of her having been led through
the streets of Rome with golden chains on her
wrists were probably picturesque inventions of the
enemies of the Borgia.</p>

<p>When the Countess was confined in the Belvedere
she made an unsuccessful attempt to escape,
whereupon Alexander had her removed to the Castle
of St. Angelo, from which, on the expiration of
about eighteen months, she was liberated, owing to
the intervention of certain French gentlemen,
especially of Yves d’Allegre. His Holiness gave
her permission to go to Florence, and commended
her to the Signory in a letter which is a masterpiece
of hypocrisy. In it he refers to our “beloved
daughter in Christ”; “we have,” he says, “not
only exercised mercy with respect to this Caterina,
but also, so far as we were able, with God’s help,
have looked with paternal solicitude after her welfare”—and
more of the same sort.</p>

<p>In Florence Caterina Sforza married Giovanni de’
Medici, and, dying in 1509, left a son of the same
mettle as herself, the famous Giovanni of the Black
Bands, the last of the great condottieri.</p>

<p>March 15, 1500, Alexander signed a bull investing
Caesar with the vicariate of Romagna, seventeen
cardinals concurring in his action. When his
Holiness had held the consistory to find ways and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
means for securing money for recovering the Church
domain, which was being held by the great lords
who refused to pay tribute and acknowledge the
Pope’s authority, it was for the purpose of
restoring the territory to the Holy See.</p>

<p>Twice delegations had come from Imola and
Forli to ask Alexander to sign the agreement made
by these cities to have the Duke of Valentino for
their governor. Had the Pope needed an excuse
for handing this territory over to his son, he could
not have had a better one. The cardinals readily
yielded to the persuasions of Alexander and Caesar.
To render the transaction perfectly legal, the Riario
were formally deprived of their domain by a decree
of the camerlengo for having failed for a number of
years to pay the tribute to the Holy See—a thousand
gold florins for Forli, two hundred for Imola, and
two silver cups for Mauri.</p>

<p>Caesar signed the agreement, March 15, 1500,
with the citizens of Imola, by which he promised
to govern them with justice and mercy; to maintain
them in peace, and defend them in time of
war; to preserve their communal rights and restore
those usurped by Count Girolamo Riario and his
successors. The great seal which the document
bears has the bull of the House of Borgia and the
three bands azure of the family of Doms, quartered
with the lilies of France. Caesar signs as lieutenant
of the King.</p>

<p>Alexander had his son invested with the office of
Gonfalonier and Captain-General of the Church,
March 29th, in the Church of St. Peter, himself
bestowing the insignia of the office—the biretta, the
baton, and the gonfalon—on Caesar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
The ceremony is described by Burchard in detail.
The Duke was clad in a doublet of brocaded gold
velvet, with large pearls for buttons; on his head
he wore a scarlet velvet cap. The biretta of
investiture, according to the Master of Ceremonies,
was of the height of two palms, bordered with
ermine, and embellished with four large pearls;
on top was a dove, fashioned also of pearls.</p>

<p>Caesar received the baton and the gonfalon as
his unfortunate brother the Duke of Gandia had
before him. The Pope in blessing the standard
repeated the prescribed formula, and then, after
performing the necessary rites, Caesar came forward,
removed his biretta, knelt before his father,
and in a firm voice repeated the solemn <span class="locked">words:—</span></p>

<p>“I, Caesar Borgia of France, Duke of Valentinois,
Gonfalonier and Captain-General of the Holy
Roman Church, swear now and henceforth to be
faithful and obedient to the Blessed Peter and to
you, my most holy Master, Alexander VI., Pope,
and to your legally constituted successors. Never
by deed or word will I enter into any conspiracy
to destroy or injure you, or to imprison you by
treachery, in short to lay violent hands on you
or your successors in any manner whatsoever, or
to do you any violence under any pretext whatsoever.
The commissions which you or your
successors entrust to me either directly by
messenger, or by letter, will be disclosed to
no one, and no one will receive from me any advice
which could turn to your disadvantage or to that
of your successors. I will aid you, and those who
shall come after you, to preserve and defend the
Pontifical State and the royal rights of St. Peter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
against any and all enemies; I will honour the
legate of the Apostolic See on his coming and
on his going, and I will lend him my aid when he
shall have need of it; I shall take care to preserve,
defend, augment, and extend the rights, honours,
privileges, and authority of the Roman Church
under you and your successors; I will take no
part in any projects, acts, or treaties which might
cloak any criminal design or enterprise prejudicial
to you or your successors, or finally to the Roman
Church; and if I should learn that any such project
has been arranged or is under way I will use all
my strength to prevent it, and as promptly as
possible; and I will inform you or your said
successors or some one who may inform you of it
in my stead. So help me God and the Holy
Angels!”</p>

<p>The Duke remained kneeling before the Pope,
who handed him the standard. Thereupon the
golden rose was brought to the Pope, who presented
it to Caesar, who was still kneeling, with
the following <span class="locked">words:—</span></p>

<p>“Receive this rose from our hands, from the
hands of him who, however unworthy, holds the
place of God on earth. It signifies the joy of
the two Jerusalems—that is, of the Church
triumphant and the Church militant—and to the
faithful in Christ it symbolises the admirable flower
which is the joy of all the saints, and constitutes
their crown. Receive it therefore, dear son, thou
who art noble in all time, and who art endowed
with so many virtues; receive it in order that you
may still further grow in virtue through Christ,
our Lord, like the rose that flourishes on the banks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
of the streams with abundant waters; and may
Christ, our Lord, deign to grant you His grace,
and in His infinite mercy may you be blessed by
Him who is Three in One in the centuries of
centuries. Amen!”</p>

<p>The Duke received the rose, kissed the Pope’s
hand and foot, and Burchard, who conducted the
ceremony, placed the toque of the gonfalonier on
Caesar’s head. Thus the hypocritical performance
ended, and Caesar, with a number of the cardinals,
accompanied the Pope to the Curia, where he took
leave of his father.</p>

<p>Caesar’s first act as Governor of Imola was to
appoint Giovanni Olivieri, Bishop of Isernia, his
lieutenant, April 10, 1500, and a few days later
he empowered him to receive the oaths of allegiance
of his new subjects in his stead. All Caesar’s
official letters at this time are countersigned
Agapitus—Agapito Gerardino of Amelia, his first
secretary, who remained with him throughout his
career. Valentino immediately turned his attention
to reorganising the government of the conquered
territory and to providing for the administration
of justice.</p>

<p>The return of Ludovico il Moro to Milan did
not prove a serious obstacle to Caesar’s plans, for
he was completely defeated by the French, under
Louis de La Trémoille, at Novara, April 10, 1500,
and taken prisoner to France, where he died on
being released ten years later—it was said—of
sheer joy.</p>

<p>Bull-fighting had been introduced into Italy by
the Spaniards in the time of Calixtus III., and
June 24, 1500, Caesar gave an exhibition of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
prowess by dispatching a number of bulls in the
open space back of St. Peter’s. He entered the
arena armed with only a short sword and killed
five of the bulls, the last with a single stroke of
his weapon, which excited much enthusiasm among
the people and secured him a reputation for great
physical strength. The event is described more
fully by Capello, the Venetian ambassador, than
by Burchard. The orator adds: “Caesar is
twenty-seven years of age, handsome of figure,
tall, and well formed; he is most regal and
extravagant—which greatly displeases the Pope; if
he lives he will be one of the great captains of
Italy.” His generosity was such that it was
described as <i xml:lang="it" lang="it">liberalita cesarea</i>, and his Court was
thronged with soldiers, artists, and men of letters,
though we look in vain for any great name among
them. The men of letters were mostly mediocre
rhymesters and Latinists whose works have been
consigned to oblivion.</p>

<p>It is hardly to be supposed that an Italian condottiere
of twenty-seven years, engrossed with the
actualities of life, fascinated by a dream of vast
power, could take very much interest in the arts.
Although Michael Angelo, Garofalo, Bramante, and
Antonio di Sangallo were in Rome at this time,
the efforts of Caesar’s eulogists to find in this,
and other similar circumstances, enhanced glory
for the young adventurer should not be taken too
seriously.</p>

<p>He undoubtedly had relations with Leonardo da
Vinci, as he availed himself of the artist’s services
as an engineer in remodelling certain fortresses
and designing machines of war. Vasari says that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
Pietro di Cosimo, the Florentine artist, who died
in 1521, painted many portraits of distinguished
persons in Rome, “including those of Virginio
Orsini, and Roberto Sanseverino, and also that of
the Duke Valentino, son of Pope Alexander VI.,
which portrait is now lost as I know, although
the artist’s preliminary sketch is in the possession
of Cosimo Bartoli.”<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a></p>

<p class="in0"><span class="pfirst">Alexander VI.</span> nearly lost his life in an accident
which occurred in the Vatican, June 27, 1500, when
the ceiling of a room fell down and he was buried
in the rubbish, from which, however, he was finally
extricated, having received only a few scratches.
His escape, according to his Holiness, was due
to the Blessed Virgin Mary; solemn thanks were
therefore rendered her July 2nd. She, however,
did not interfere about two weeks after Alexander’s
providential escape to prevent the brutal murder
of Lucretia Borgia’s second husband, Alfonso of
Naples, Duke of Bisceglia.</p>

<p>Early in the evening, July 15th, Alfonso was
attacked at the entrance to St. Peter’s by several
armed men and wounded in the head, the right
arm, and the leg. The ruffians, about forty in
number, ran down the steps of the church, hastily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
mounted their horses, and escaped by the Pertusa
Gate. Such is Burchard’s account of the affair.</p>

<p>The orator of Naples adds: “And the prince
ran to the Pope and told him that he had been
attacked and wounded, and Madonna Lucretia, who
was with the Pope, fainted.” Alfonso was placed
in a room in the Vatican, and his wife and his
sister, Sancia, consort of the Pope’s son Giuffre,
Prince of Squillace, took entire care of him, even
cooking his meals themselves for fear of poison,
owing to Valentino’s hatred of him. The Pope had
him guarded by sixteen men, fearing the Duke
might murder him. Only on one occasion, when
the Pope went to see Alfonso, did Caesar accompany
him, and then he was heard to remark to his
father, “What is not finished at dinner may be
finished at supper.” When the orator asked the
Pope about the affair his Holiness told him that
Valentino said, “I did not attack Alfonso, but
if I had done so, it would have only been
what he deserved”; but one day—August 17th—-Caesar
entered the wounded man’s room, drove
Lucretia and Sancia out, and ordered Don Michele
to strangle the youth, and that night the body was
buried—a murder so cold-blooded that all Rome
was horrified, though no one dared mention it
openly. Finally Valentino admitted that he had
caused Alfonso’s death because he feared the Duke
would murder him. Such is Capello’s account.
Burchard adds that Alfonso’s physicians and
attendants were arrested and examined but
immediately set at liberty, as there was no
doubt of their innocence.</p>

<p>Alfonso, sacrificed by his father for political<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
reasons, had married Lucretia, and when the plans
of Alexander and Caesar required his elimination
she was unable to save him. He had been frequently
warned by his friends that Rome was a
dangerous place for him. Caesar hated the House
of Aragon, and he had derived no greater profit
from his sister’s marriage with Alfonso than he
had from her former union with Giovanni Sforza
of Pesaro. Valentino apparently had another
alliance in mind for his sister which he hoped
would prove more advantageous to himself.</p>

<p>As a son had been born to Lucretia and Alfonso,
the marriage could not be set aside as easily as
the former had been; therefore heroic treatment
was necessary. When the war broke out in Milan
Alfonso left Rome, and he returned only on the
urgent solicitations of his wife and the Pope, his
fears having been somewhat allayed by the warm
congratulations which Caesar had sent him on the
birth of his son.</p>

<p>In a dispatch of July 19th the Venetian
ambassador says: “It is not certain who
wounded Alfonso, but it is said to have been
the same person who killed the Duke of Gandia!”</p>

<p>Burchard merely records: “Alfonso was
strangled in his bed about the nineteenth hour,
and in the evening, about the first hour of the
night, the body was carried to the basilica of St.
Peter, accompanied by Francesco Borgia, Archbishop
of Cosenza, and his household.”</p>

<p>Various reasons have been adduced to explain
Caesar’s hatred of his sister’s husband. It has even
been said that Caesar wished to have him out of
the way in order that he himself might enjoy her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
favours; however, although this charge and others
equally hideous, which were made at the time, are
no longer believed, they show to what extremes
calumny would go in those days and how ready
chroniclers and historians, inspired by hate, were to
repeat slanders; but they also show the execration
and abhorrence in which the Borgias were held.</p>

<p>There was a Neapolitan party in Rome, and
Alfonso may have been a member of it; his sister
Sancia was the wife of Giuffre, Caesar’s brother,
and probably the latter’s mistress. Subsequently
she and Valentino became bitter enemies, and she
was the only person about the Vatican who dared
oppose him in anything.</p>

<p>All Rome, prelates, citizens, Lucretia, Giuffre,
the Pope himself seemed afraid of Caesar. Of
the Pope it was said that he both loved and feared
him—<i xml:lang="it" lang="it">ama ed ha paura</i>. Valentino, hating the
House of Naples, and especially Sancia, whose
strong nature and unprincipled character clashed
with his own, could easily bring himself to compass
the death of her brother because it would also
leave his sister free for him to marry her into some
powerful family which would prove of great assistance
to him in his far-reaching projects.</p>

<p>Lucretia and Alfonso, whom his contemporaries
described as one of the handsomest men in Italy,
apparently loved each other. She had been greatly
distressed when he fled from Rome, and had begged
him to return. On his death Lucretia, who was
wholly without will and character, who had none
of the traits of the virago, such as Caterina Sforza
possessed, retired to Nepi for a time.</p>

<p>In speaking of the prompt release of Alfonso’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
physicians and servants, “because they were
innocent,” Burchard adds the significant remark,
“as those sent to arrest them knew perfectly.”</p>

<p>The attack on the Duke of Bisceglia evidently
was well planned, and he was subsequently
strangled within the very walls of the Vatican.
The servants and physicians were immediately
exonerated. Who, then, was responsible for the
murder?</p>

<p>All the chroniclers, historians, and ambassadors
either openly or by implication charge Caesar with
the crime. According to the standards of that
perfidious and brutal age, he had ample grounds
for the murder—grounds based on both personal
hatred and on political ambition.</p>

<p>The conquest of Romagna was intimately connected
with the aims of the King of France with
respect to Naples, and Alfonso was an obstacle
in Caesar’s path. The Neapolitan House had refused
Valentino one of its daughters for wife, and
he had married a French princess; the destruction
of the Aragonese family was therefore the
logical sequel.</p>

<p>When Alfonso of Bisceglia was murdered,
Lucretia was only twenty years of age; she was
beautiful and wealthy, and had powerful kinsmen
and a considerable domain of her own; it would
be a comparatively easy matter, in view of these
attractions, to find her another husband in one of
the great families of the peninsula, who would be
of help to Alexander and Caesar in subjugating
Romagna, and in any other ambitious projects they
might evolve.</p>

<p>Alfonso of Bisceglia was useless to such practical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
men as Valentino and his father; he was
honest, gentle, and weak, and such men had even
less place in the swift movement of the Renaissance
than they have in modern politics and industry,
and he had to be removed.</p>

<p>Alexander perhaps recognised his own blood in
Caesar, and discovered in him the same cynical
contempt for all laws, human and Divine, that he
himself felt. If he had any horror of his son’s deed,
it was not of long duration, for Capello, wrote in
September, a month after the murder: “The Pope
is daily growing younger; his greatest sorrows
pass in a night; he is of a most cheerful disposition,
and never undertakes anything but what
promises to turn to his own profit; all his thoughts
are directed to a single end—to make great
personages of his children—to all else he is indifferent.”</p>

<p>Efforts have been made to place the responsibility
for the murder of Alfonso on the Sanseverini, who
were robbed of the Principality of Salerno in order
that it might be given the prince; and on the
Gaetani, who had been despoiled of the Duchy of
Sermoneta that it might be bestowed on Alfonso’s
infant son, Rodrigo. However, neither of these
families, who must also have had their enemies, was
ever charged with the crime by their contemporaries,
and had Caesar and Alexander ever suspected either
of them, they certainly would not have treated the
affair with such indifference. The only one charged
with it at the time was the Duke of Valentino.</p>

<p>An ingenious eulogist of the Borgias has
suggested that the strangling in the Borgia tower,
which was doubtless reported by Lucretia or Sancia,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
was no strangling at all, but probably tetanic convulsions
due to infected wounds caused by the
daggers—poignards usually being cleaned in the
earth; he, however, neglects to explain away
the attack when the daggers were used two weeks
before.</p>

<p>Early in July the Pope had placed the ban on
Faenza, on the ground that Astorre Manfredi had
refused to pay the tribute; the reduction of Faenza
and Rimini, therefore, was decided upon by the
Pope and Caesar. By his ambassador, Villeneuve,
Louis XII. sent his consent for the undertaking,
and also his promise to help as far as he was
able. In addition the Venetian ambassador assured
the Vatican of the neutrality of his Government.</p>

<p>Valentinois had formed an army which he was
holding in Umbria, in order that it might be
near at hand to be used to destroy the Colonna,
who were allies of Federigo of Naples, or for the
operations in Romagna.</p>

<p>According to the statement of the Venetian
orator, the King of France was to furnish six
hundred men-at-arms and the same number of
Swiss, in case it should be necessary to crush the
Bentivoglio of Bologna, who might attempt to aid
their kinsmen in Faenza, Rimini, and Pesaro. On
the advice of the King they had withdrawn their
protection from the Malatesta and the Manfredi.</p>

<p>When the letter of the Signory was delivered by
the ambassadors, Capello and Giorgi, the Pope was
so delighted that in spite of his promise to keep
it secret, the whole palace knew of it at once, and
the same night a great banquet was given in
celebration of the event.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
When Valentino was ready to set forth on the
second campaign for the conquest of Romagna,
he had about ten thousand soldiers, partly enlisted
by himself and partly by Paolo Orsini and Giampaolo
Baglioni, who were waiting for him and his
army in Perugia.</p>

<p>Caesar’s departure from Rome having become
known, October 5th, Pandolfo Malatesta sent his
wife and children to the Court of his brother-in-law,
Giovanni Bentivoglio, in Bologna, and fortified
himself in the castle of Rimini, knowing
he could no longer count on the help of
Venice.</p>

<p>To secure funds for the second campaign in
Romagna, Alexander created twelve cardinals,
charging each of them one-tenth of the ecclesiastical
revenues. To this was added the plunder
derived from the Gaetani and other Roman nobles,
and large sums were borrowed from the great
banker Agostino Chigi. This was one of the worst
scandals of Alexander’s reign. At this creation
two members of the Borgia family were made cardinals—Francesco
of Sueca and Pier Luigi, the
Pope’s nephew. All the cardinals except the
last paid well for the dignity. The Bishop of
Catania paid the highest—the enormous sum of
25,000 gold ducats; Louis, Bishop of Acqui, and
Jacobus, Archbishop of Oristano, paid 5,000 each;
while D’Albret, Caesar’s brother-in-law, was
charged ten thousand.</p>

<p>It is Burchard himself who gives the amount each
cardinal was required to pay. This creation was
entirely political. Caesar had found that he needed
money for his undertakings, and he had enjoined<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
the Sacred College to ratify the nominations, and
he had fixed the prices himself.</p>

<p>September 26th Capello wrote the Signory: “I
understand that orders have been given so that—the
cardinals having been selected—the Duke of
Valentinois may set out in two or three days, provided
the astrologers say that the moment is
favourable.”</p>

<p>The Holy Father, by the agreement with the King
of France, was to help Louis in case he decided
to undertake the conquest of Naples, and the King
was to aid Caesar, to whom he now sent a considerable
force under Yves d’Allegre.</p>

<p>Caesar’s foot-soldiers were clad in red and yellow
doublets with his insignia, and were armed with
short pikes and swords and casques of iron. They
were well drilled, and far superior to the earlier
troops, which had been little more than poorly
armed mobs.</p>

<p>The army set forth the last of September, and
it soon became known that it was Caesar’s intention
to drive Giovanni Sforza from Pesaro, and the last
of the Malatesta from Rimini. Sforza was a military
commander of no little reputation, and he
decided to resist. He first endeavoured to secure
the help of his former wife’s brother, Francesco
Gonzaga, and also that of the Emperor Maximilian,
with whom he was connected through Bianca
Sforza.</p>

<p>Early in 1500 Gonzaga had asked Valentino to
stand as sponsor for his infant son, a child who two
years later was betrothed to Caesar’s own daughter
by Charlotte d’Albret. Giovanni Sforza plainly had
not appreciated the relations of Valentino with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
Gonzaga family, who, like all the princely families
of Italy at that time, were ever ready to ally themselves
with the stronger and especially with the
Papacy.</p>

<p>Struggling for existence, all were playing
a desperate game of politics. The duplicity of
the age is again disclosed by the fact that Gonzaga
did send one hundred men to the assistance of the
Lord of Pesaro, who had only two hundred of his
own. Giovanni had not been an altogether unjust
ruler, consequently a considerable portion of his
subjects remained loyal to him. While the nobles
opposed him he could count on the support of the
lower classes; the middle classes, as is usual, held
aloof, ready to go over to the victor.</p>

<p>Most of the petty lords in the Romagna were
upstarts and adventurers, and as such were tyrants
and entirely indifferent to the welfare of their
subjects; being politicians, they were wholly unable
to look ahead and provide for the future—their
measures were always mere temporary expedients
to provide against present difficulties, chiefly of
a personal nature; being both ignorant and egotistical,
they had no just appreciation of their actual
position, which they were compelled to hold by
force; the result was that they themselves were
constantly the victims of the treachery of their
subjects—if treachery it could be called, for their
people professed no loyalty. For them a change of
masters only meant a change of evils, with the
chance that for a while, at least, their condition
would be ameliorated. When the people did not
actually oppose their lords, they were indifferent
to them. This explains why many of the cities
in Romagna made no resistance and voluntarily
opened their gates to Caesar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
Pesaro promptly surrendered to Bentivoglio,
Caesar’s lieutenant, but before the town yielded
Giovanni Sforza managed to make his escape, and
October 27th the Duke himself entered the city
with his usual brilliant array of nobles and officers,
by which he knew he could impress the vulgar
imagination. Valentino was theatrical in whatever
he did, and he studiously preserved an
air of mystery at all times. When in Rome he
would keep himself in seclusion, and then suddenly
on some pretext would exhibit himself to the
populace.</p>

<p>The castle of Pesaro was famous for its strength,
and Caesar had sketches made of it, which he sent
to his father, who was interested in affairs military.</p>

<p>Pandolfo Collenuccio, Ercole d’Este’s orator,
arrived in Pesaro the very day Caesar entered the
place, and the Duke sent Don Remiro de Lorca to
call on him.</p>

<p>Collenuccio, a humanist of great reputation
among the writers and jurists of the day, had been
exiled in 1489 by Giovanni Sforza in order that he
might confiscate the scholar’s property, and at the
same time be rid of an honest counsellor. After
holding offices in various cities of Italy, he had
entered the service of the Este of Ferrara.</p>

<p>Caesar sent the orator a present of grain, wine,
candles, a sheep, and a number of capons and
chickens, and in writing to his master, Pandolfo
said Caesar was “brave and generous—and it is
believed he will take care of deserving men. He
is determined in his vengeance; his is a great soul,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
eager for glory and power, but he seems more
anxious to acquire new States than to give those
he already has a good government”—a statement
which does not wholly agree with those of others.
Pandolfo, however, failed to secure a public office,
consequently he discovered some of the Duke’s
defects.</p>

<p>One day when conversing with the ambassador,
Caesar remarked: “I do not know what Faenza
will do, but she will not cause us any greater difficulties
than the other places have—still, she may
try to hold out.” To which the accomplished diplomatist
replied: “If she does it will only give your
lordship another opportunity to display your valour
and skill in taking the place.”</p>

<p>In one of his letters to the Duke, Ercole d’Este,
Collenuccio gives a description of Caesar’s personal
habits which is interesting, as details regarding
his private life are few. “The Duke’s life is
as follows: he goes to bed between eight and ten
at night. At the eighteenth hour it is dawn; at
the nineteenth the sun rises, and at the twentieth
it is broad daylight. Then he rises and immediately
sits down to the table. After this he gives his
attention to business affairs.”</p>

<p>While Caesar was in Fano and Pesaro, Astorre
Manfredi—the only tyrant in that part of Italy who
enjoyed the confidence and affection of his people—was
preparing to defend himself in Faenza.</p>

<p>Aid came to him from an unexpected quarter,
for Giovanni Bentivoglio, fearing that Valentino
would attack him if Faenza fell, determined to help
the youthful tyrant. Bentivoglio had managed to
secure the goodwill of the French, and had entered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
into treaties with several of his neighbours. Among
others, Florence had promised to aid him if he
would assist her when she attacked Pisa. Late in
October the Pope sent a letter to Bentivoglio, commanding
him, under pain of excommunication, to
take no part in the affairs of Faenza—the only
effect of which was to increase his determination
to help Manfredi by sending him additional troops.
At the same time Bentivoglio strengthened his own
defences.</p>

<p>When Valentino left Pesaro, he placed a
Spaniard, Marco Suere, in charge of the citadel.
Rimini was surrendered without a struggle by its
pusillanimous lord, Pandolfaccio Malatesta.</p>

<p>Astorre Manfredi, who was only eighteen, had
discovered as early as January, 1500, that Caesar
had designs on his territory, although he had been
assured by Valentino of his friendship.</p>

<p>Early in November Caesar’s captain, Vitellozzo
Vitelli, occupied Brisighella, which was the key to
Faenza, and all the petty powers of the neighbourhood
hastened to go over to Valentino, feeling
certain that he would win. Astorre had counted
on Venice, but he soon found that she had allied
herself with the Pope, for in October Caesar’s name
was inscribed in her “book of gold,” and the Senate
had voted him a palace for residence in Venice,
although it had refused to grant him the title, which
he had coveted, of Captain of the Armies of the
Republic.</p>

<p>Manfredi was brave, but he saw that his cause
was hopeless. In his extremity he suggested to
his people that they make no resistance in order
that useless bloodshed and destruction of property<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
might be avoided, but to their great credit and
his own they decided to support him to the last.
In the meantime Bentivoglio had succeeded in
getting a thousand infantry to Manfredi.</p>

<p>Faenza was invested November 10th, and Caesar
offered the besieged their lives if they would surrender;
promises were followed by threats, but the
inhabitants of the place remained firm. Winter was
drawing near and Faenza was well protected with
walls. Caesar established his camp on the side
towards Forli, and attempted to storm the walls,
but failed. Valentino had expected the youthful
tyrant to offer him a pitched battle, but Manfredi
wisely refrained, and Caesar’s troops suffered so
from the severe weather that he decided to go into
winter quarters. The people of Faenza had
destroyed all the timber in the vicinity; the troops
were encamped in a low, wet place, and they were
constantly harassed by the enemy. Astorre’s men
were well fed and sheltered, and were able to rest
at night, while the besiegers were never secure;
Caesar therefore decided to raise the siege, and
announced he would return when the season was
more favourable. He withdrew December 3rd, but
was careful to secure all roads leading to Faenza,
and to invest the city in such a manner that no
provisions could be introduced into it. He passed
the winter in Cesena, remaining until April, 1501.
The time was spent in all sorts of spectacular sports
and amusements, and when he departed he left
behind him the memory of an amiable and affable
lord, and at the same time that of an able governor
and severe justiciary. The accounts we have of
his daily life are chiefly by panegyrists who were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
enjoying his bounty and protection, consequently,
as evidence of his actual character, they are worth
little more than are the ferocious attacks of the
enemies of the Borgia.</p>

<p>While Caesar was in Forli, the usual number of
avaricious artists and literary men flocked about
him, greedy for money or honours, and clamouring
for permission to dedicate their works—works for
the most part now lost—to him. This servility
is a curious phase of the literary character of those
and even later days, and the ridiculously bombastic
dedications of books to various tyrants and adventurers,
stained with every crime, and incapable of
appreciating anything upright and noble, is nauseating.
However, the painters and poetasters who
shone by the reflected light of some political
adventurer as a rule passed away with him, and
such of their works as have been spared by time
are of a nature to console us for those which have
been lost. All these dedications and panegyrics
were inspired by the hope of reward in some form,
and as evidence that the person addressed possessed
any characteristics worthy of admiration they are
of no value. The names of Caesar’s eulogists were
legion, and in him they discerned every virtue,
just as his political adversaries and their sycophants
discovered every vice. While Caesar was in Cesena
the youthful Manfredi, although definitely abandoned
by both Bologna and Florence, was holding
out bravely.</p>

<p>Alexander, knowing that Louis XII. would
require his investiture for the realisation of his
designs regarding the Kingdom of Naples, complained
to him that his ally, Giovanni Bentivoglio,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
had frustrated Caesar’s plans with respect to
Faenza, although their failure was due more to
Manfredi’s stout resistance and the severity of the
winter than to the assistance of the tyrant of
Bologna. His Holiness even went so far as to
demand possession of the territory of the
Bentivoglio.</p>

<p>January 28, 1501, the Pope threatened Bologna
with the interdict in case lodging and supplies were
not ready for Caesar’s troops within six days. The
King of France, however, was more diplomatic,
for he dispatched a letter from Blois, January 30,
1501, in which he “besought his great and good
friend of Bologna to aid our said cousin of
Valentinois with men, provisions, and artillery.”</p>

<p>Bentivoglio did furnish lodgings, supplies, and
men, but absolutely refused to allow the castle of
Bologna to be occupied by Caesar’s troops, because,
as he said, this would endanger his authority too
much. Alexander had demanded possession of the
stronghold on the ground that it was required for
Caesar’s operations in the Romagna, but Bentivoglio
was not to be deceived.</p>

<p>Valentino spent the early months of the year
1500 organising the government of the territories
bordering on the Adriatic, but he kept a close
watch on Faenza, which he again attacked about
the middle of April, but without accomplishing anything.
The skill and valour of Manfredi and his
followers won the admiration of all Italy, and
Isabella d’Este, writing to her husband, the Marquis
of Mantua, April 20th, said: “The people of
Faenza have saved the honour of Italy”; and
Caesar is reported to have remarked: “Had I at
my command an army like the defenders of Faenza
I could confidently undertake the conquest of the
entire peninsula.”</p>

</p></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
Manfredi, however, was finally reduced to the
necessity of asking for an armistice to arrange the
terms of surrender and the night of April 21st
he was received by Caesar at his headquarters with
marked courtesy. The terms of the capitulation
were drawn up in Caesar’s name by Battista Orfino,
and Michelotto Corella was placed in charge of
the stronghold.</p>

<p>The brave Manfredi was to be allowed to go
whithersoever he wished; his officers also were permitted
to depart; the people and their property
were to be respected; the coins struck by the prince
were to remain current in the State; his debts were
to be paid by Caesar, and to enable the people
to regain their prosperity they were to be granted
certain exemptions in the matter of taxes.</p>

<p>Manfredi, deceived by Caesar’s promises, instead
of going to his friends and kinsmen in
Bologna or Venice, accepted the Duke’s invitation
to remain in his camp, and he probably stayed
with Valentino until his arrival at the Vatican,
June 17, 1501. A few days later he was flung into
prison in the Castle of St. Angelo.</p>

<p>After the fall of Faenza Valentino directed his
attention to Giovanni Bentivoglio, demanding
possession of Castle Bolognese in the name of the
Pope. When Bentivoglio learned that Caesar was
advancing with troops he dispatched ambassadors,
who were promptly seized by Vitellozzo, who had
captured the strongholds of San Pietro, Frumina,
Guelfo, and Medicina. Bentivoglio, seeing that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
Caesar was determined, decided to yield, but he
cunningly planned to secure him as an ally at the
same time. April 30, 1501, Paolo Orsini negotiated
a treaty between Caesar and Bentivoglio by which,
in return for the surrender of Castle Bolognese, the
former was to serve the latter as condottiere for
three years with adequate pay, in all undertakings
except such as might be directed against the King
of France. Caesar was also to furnish a certain
number of troops. Giulio and Paolo Orsini and
Vitellozzo Vitelli signed the treaty for Caesar, who
had remained at Medicina and who was for the first
time designated as the Duke of Romagna in this
document, his father having just conferred this title
upon him. Caesar’s consent to this arrangement is
explained by the fact that the King of France had
demanded the return of his troops and the Pope
had instructed Valentino to come to Rome without
molesting the Florentines.</p>

<p>Giuliano and Piero de’ Medici, anxious to recover
possession of the city from which they had been
expelled, proposed to enter into an alliance with
Caesar. Giuliano joined him at Bologna, intending to
remain on his staff as he advanced through Tuscany
and rally his own adherents. Piero also came from
Rome to join Caesar, who knew that their presence
in his army and the hatred of his captains for
Florence would constitute a menace to the
Republic; he therefore refused to enter into
any agreement with Piero, and on the way
to Bisagno he compelled Giuliano to stop at
Loiano.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this the Signory of Florence felt
that he had some sinister purpose with respect to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
themselves, consequently they sent Machiavelli to
watch and study Caesar’s movements.</p>

<p>Valentino had asked permission to lead his troops
through Florentine territory, and the request, with
certain restrictions—among them one requiring him
to avoid the fortified places—was granted. The
Duke did not wait for the envoys but continued
his march, and when they did appear he was
already on Florentine territory. They threatened
to lodge a complaint, but Valentino upbraided them
for the attitude of their Government towards himself
and his undertakings. He did not wish to
declare himself an enemy of the Republic, but he
needed time to consider the situation; he therefore
made an appointment to meet the envoys again
at Barberino di Mugello.</p>

<p>Owing to her long and exhausting war with Pisa
and to her intestine troubles Florence was in no
position to risk a struggle with the Duke of
Romagna; the Signory had therefore decided to
grant his request. Appreciating the danger of
having a large number of armed men in their
territory, the Council of Ten made arrangements
for resisting any sudden attack. Caesar finally
entered into an alliance, both offensive and defensive,
with Florence, and the Signory took him into
its employ as condottiere, furnishing him the
number of troops befitting his rank and promising
him suitable remuneration. The arrangement was
for three years.</p>

<p>Caesar had agreed to continue his march as soon
as the convention was signed, but May 17th he
was still at Forno dei Campi, and he asked for
half the artillery belonging to Florence for use<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
against Piombino and also for his first quarter’s
salary. The Signory replied that these requests
were not included in the agreement, and Caesar
did not insist. He, however, dispatched Vitellozzo
Vitelli to the Pisans to demand their siege pieces.
On the march towards Pisa Caesar’s troops committed
great depredation, sacking, burning, and
plundering. His captains, the Orsini and Vitelli—especially
the latter, whose brother had been
executed by the Florentines—may have been
responsible for this. The Pope had sanctioned
Caesar’s undertaking with respect to Piombino,
whose lord, Giacomo d’Appiano, after a feeble
resistance before the city, retired to the stronghold,
which was well fitted to resist a siege. Here it
was that Giacomo’s grandfather had bravely defended
himself fifty years before against the
ferocious condottiere Sigismondo Malatesta, son of
Pandolfo, Lord of Rimini.</p>

<p>By his agreement with Louis XII. Caesar was
compelled to join the French army about the middle
of June. He therefore left a part of his forces to
invest Piombino, which surrendered to his lieutenants
after a two-months siege, and set out for
Rome, where he arrived June 17, 1501. His
purpose in coming to Rome at this time was to
join the French army which was about to set forth
for Naples. While in the city he concealed himself
from public gaze in the apostolic palace, rarely
showing himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
Nothing illustrates the duplicity of the age
better than this coalition of the head of the Christian
Church and the King of France for the destruction
of the House of Naples. Only four years
before Caesar, as cardinal-legate, had crowned the
last of the Aragonese Kings of Naples; three times
Alexander had endeavoured to marry one of his
children into this family, and he had become connected
with it by the marriage of his son Giuffre
with Doña Sancia, and that of his daughter Lucretia
with Alfonso, Prince of Bisceglia, whom Caesar
had murdered—and in this perfidious age the most
perfidious of all was the head of the Christian
Church.</p>

<p>In 1499 Louis XII. had secured the Pope’s consent
to his undertaking with respect to the Kingdom
of Naples and the Duchy of Milan.</p>

<p>This, as we have seen, was one of those immoral
bargains which powers and potentates still make
at the expense of weaker States, although the bald
egoism of the ruler is now less in evidence in these
transactions than it was during the Renaissance.
To-day the heads of government, being shorn of
autocratic power, do not represent personal ambition
or achievement; they are either simply
survivals of mediaevalism or the representatives of
some interest or faction—of an industrial unit of
some sort; therefore in advanced countries the
actual egoism of the ruler is of slight moment.</p>

<p>In the age of the Borgia the personality of the
ruler was more important; the extension of his power—in
fact, his very tenure of office and position—depended
on his physical strength, his cunning, his
powers of dissimulation, his predilections, his ambitions,
his morals. He was hampered by no constitutional
restrictions and his dynasty required for
its perpetuation something more than law; the
domination of his family could be secured only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
by force and fraud. The heads of governments
to-day being mere accidents of birth or the product
of economic interests, their accession to positions
of nominal power and their abandonment of those
positions have no appreciable influence upon the
destinies of States; they are products of one class
of economic or social factors just as the despots
of the Renaissance were the products of another
group.</p>

<p>Louis XII. was a ferocious egoist just as were
Alexander VI. and Caesar Borgia. He had desired
a divorce from Jeanne of France in order that he
might marry Anne of Bretagne. Superstition, if
not universal, was then general, and was not, as
it is now, confined to the ignorant and depraved;
rationalism and personal independence had not
reached the stage when mankind sees how absurd
and preposterous it is to entrust the conscience to
the care and guidance of another man and especially
a bad one. During the latter half of the
fifteenth century, when the Popes were more
depraved than they ever were before or have been
since, other monarchs were especially anxious to
secure the pontiff’s assent to their own egotistical
undertakings and the more determined to avoid
his weapon of excommunication, ridiculous as it
was. Louis, therefore, had made a bargain with
the Pope by which the latter was to sanction and aid
in the destruction of Naples and Milan, and also
to grant the necessary dispensation to enable the
King to put aside his wife. In return the King had
created the Pope’s son, Caesar, Duke of Valentinois,
and had secured for him the hand of a French
princess; the bargain had been made and formally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
sealed, and now Louis was endeavouring to compel
the Pope to perform his part of the agreement.
The House of Aragon, by right of conquest, which
it may be observed is no <em>right</em> at all, had ruled
Southern Italy for a hundred years, but its days
were now numbered. To give his project an appearance
of right Louis had based his claim to
Naples on the imaginary rights of the House of
Anjou.</p>

<p>Caesar came quietly to Rome the evening of
June 17, 1501. The 19th Yves d’Allegre arrived
with his men-at-arms, who were to be placed under
Valentino’s command. Acqua Traversa was
selected for the French camp, and Burchard
enumerates the supplies required for the troops;
wine, bread, meat, eggs, cheese, fruit, and even
sixteen harlots were allotted them. He also informs
us that certain Florentine merchants who were
required to lodge the officers paid the Governor of
the city two hundred ducats to be relieved of the
burden, and that the official accepted the money,
but, nevertheless, when the French officers arrived
compelled the Florentines to lodge them.</p>

<p>Berault Stuart, commander of the main body of
the French forces, entered Rome June 23rd and
was received by all the cardinals and the Pope’s
household with great honours. He immediately
repaired to the papal palace and was conducted
to the Pope in the Chamber of the Papagalli.</p>

<p>“To-day the King’s lieutenants and several of
the captains of the French army went to see the
Pope in his palace in Rome, where a great many
cardinals and nobles of the city were gathered.
The Pope is a Spaniard and a poor Frenchman,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
but he concealed his real feelings and received
the French officers with great cordiality and conversed
with them good-naturedly. To Monsieur
Berault Stuart, the King’s Lieutenant-General, he
presented a grey charger, strong and swift, perfectly
broken, and richly caparisoned. The rest
of the day was spent in sports and various pastimes
until evening, when the Cardinal of Sanseverino,
Bishop of Maillezais and brother of the Count of
Gayas, entertained the officers at a formal banquet
at which the viands were <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">exquises et plaisants</i>. The
banquet was given in Cardinal Ascanio’s garden
amid the oranges, lemons, pomegranates, and other
rare and esteemed fruits and fragrant flowers of
various sorts, while singers and players, both tragic
and comic, displayed their arts. The banquet over,
the Frenchmen went and took leave of the Holy
Father. This done they returned to their camp.
It had been decided that the army should set forth
the following morning, to go directly to Naples
and continue the work begun.”<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a></p>

infantry and the cavalry leading, the file two miles
long. The “men-at-arms in good order and fair
array, encased in their armour and, with lances
on thighs, wearing their casques ready for battle—thus
they traversed Rome, the trumpets and
clarions sounding, and the great Swiss drums
thundering. On the low battlements of the Castle of
St. Angelo stood the Pope, surrounded by bishops,
archbishops, and cardinals. The illustrious Duke
of Romagna and numerous other gentlemen of
Rome were with him, and as the army marched by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
the Holy Father gave it the apostolic blessing;
then the troops passed through the city gates and
marched forth in the direction of the Kingdom of
Naples and they moved rapidly and in perfect
order.”</p>

<p>Caesar remained in Rome until July 9, 1501,
when he left for Naples, but Burchard adds that
he believed he returned to the city again the same
evening.</p>

<p>In a secret consistory, June 25th, Frederic of
Aragon had been declared deprived of the Kingdom
of Naples, and the King of France invested with
it. The 29th the league between the Pope and
Louis XII. was solemnly proclaimed in St. Peter’s,
the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Te Deum</i> was sung, and his Holiness repeated
the Lord’s Prayer and gave his benediction.</p>

<p>On the way to Naples the French destroyed
Marino and Cavi, while San Germano opened its
gates to the invaders. Fabrizio and Prospero
Colonna, who had abandoned their domain to the
Pope, were Frederic’s only allies, but in his employ
he had the famous condottiere Rinuccio da
Marciano, who with Fabrizio Colonna had command
of the forces in Capua. On the approach
of the French Frederic promptly retired to Naples,
where he was pursued by D’Aubigny, while Valentino
and Sanseverino laid vigorous siege to Capua.
The siege lasted for eight days, at the end of which
time Fabrizio Colonna, seeing that further resistance
was useless, endeavoured to arrange a meeting
to agree upon the terms of surrender, but in the
meantime a traitor had opened the gates and the
French army rushed into the town.</p>

<p>“After the wall was destroyed and a breach<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
effected large enough to permit of the assault, the
King’s lieutenants had the trumpets and clarions
sound the charge, and the drums beaten to arouse
the army; the men-at-arms were given all the wine
they wanted—to lend them courage—that the valour
of France might humble the pride of Italy—and
Messire Berault Stuart, Lieutenant-General of the
King, addressed the men; on the conclusion of
his speech the French were fired with courage and
resolved to stand firm in the midst of the terrible
adventures of war—and there, whether they
lived or died, to maintain the justice of their
King’s quarrel. And the assault was given
about eleven o’clock on the morning of
July 25th and was begun by the infantry, and
a hand-to-hand fight ensued and the air was filled
with spears and arrows and flashing swords—and
beyond was the fire and smoke of the artillery—in
the streets of the town pikes and halberds clashed—rude
was the attack—but so bravely met that in
less than half an hour more than two hundred
French and Germans were killed in the breach—and
the men of Don Frederic—of a truth they received
their share of the blows and many were slain—and
the troopers had no rest and it would have
gone ill with the French if their men-at-arms had
not come to their aid—and the shedding of human
blood was each man’s care—and the Neapolitans
and the Colonna maintained their quarrel with the
sweat of their brow and the blood of their bodies—but
the French continued to attack so furiously
that the enemy knew not how to save themselves,
except by flight—so they fell back and the French
gained the breach—and they carried the town by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
assault and entered—and rivers of blood were shed
and men innumerable slaughtered—the soldiers destroyed
all whom they found armed in the streets,
or hiding in the houses—giving quarter to none—whatever
his condition—so that down the streets
in great streams ran the blood. I will not describe
the groans and shrieks of despairing women who
beheld their husbands murdered, or the cries of the
children over their slaughtered fathers, or the grief
of the old men who saw their homes robbed and
their city destroyed—but I will say that besides
the butchery of the men, many maidens and women
were violated and forced, which is the culmination
of the horrors of war. The foot-soldiers of the
Duke of Valentino managed to secure thirty of
the most beautiful women of the city, who were
carried away prisoners to Rome.”</p>

<p>The chronicler Jean d’Auton adds that to escape
dishonour numerous women committed suicide; that
many of the soldiers made themselves rich for life
with the plunder, which caused them henceforth to
be all the more eager for war. Between seven and
eight thousand people were killed. Those of the
men who were left, together with the women and
priests, fled and hid in the belfries and towers of
the churches, in the caves, and among the rocks,
but the next day they were hunted out and held for
ransom.</p>

<p>Fabrizio Colonna was captured, and his enemy,
Giangiordano Orsini, generously furnished his
ransom. Rinuccio da Marciano, wounded in the
fight, was taken prisoner by Valentino’s men and
died two days later—Guicciardini maintains of
poison. Giovio says Marciano’s wounds were
poisoned by Vitellozzo in revenge for the
death of his brother Paolo, who had been
condemned by Rinuccio’s faction in Florence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
July 26th news reached the Pope of the capture
of Capua by Caesar, <i xml:lang="it" lang="it">per ducem Valentinum</i>, says
Burchard; but the importance of Caesar’s part in
it seems to have been exaggerated, although he
was one of the signers of the agreement between
the King of France and King Frederic of Naples,
by which the latter was to retire to Ischia for
six months, and if he obtained help within that
time he was to be allowed to denounce the armistice
and endeavour to recover his throne. He was
permitted to remove all his property, except his
artillery and provisions. In case he failed to secure
assistance within six months he agreed to abandon
Ischia and Salerno, and was to be allowed to go
wherever he wished. In about a month he saw
that further resistance was useless and set sail for
France, where he was received by Louis XII., who
presented him with the Duchy of Anjou and a
pension suitable to his rank. The unfortunate King
of Naples died an exile September 9, 1504. When
he left his kingdom he was accompanied by Sannazzaro,
the famous poet, who was one of the
bitterest of the enemies of the Borgia, and whose
epigrams have perhaps done more than anything
else to perpetuate the memory of their infamy.</p>

<p>Before Caesar returned to Rome the King of
France sent Edouart Buillon to Naples to thank
him for his services. The instructions to the envoy
are dated August 8, 1501. He is to tell Valentino
that the King has been informed of his great and
good services in the conquest of Naples, for which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
he thanks him with all his heart, and that
the King also recognises the goodwill the Duke
bears him and which he purposes to reward by
assisting him in his own affairs and treating him
as his good friend and relative.</p>

<p>The King further requests Valentino to withdraw
all his forces, except his own company,
from the Regno, and to hold them in readiness
and good order for use should occasion arise. He
explains that this is necessary on account of the
great gathering of men about Naples and the difficulty
of providing for so many. He also enjoins
him to prevent his men from robbing and pillaging.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a></p>

<p>Caesar’s lieutenants in the north—with whom he
remained in communication while he was in Naples—had
advanced his projects to some extent, Vitellozzo
Vitelli and Paolo Orsini having secured
possession of Piombino, September 3rd.</p>

<p>Valentino returned to Rome with his men
September 15, 1501.</p>

<p>Burchard describes an orgy which took place
in Caesar’s apartments in the apostolic palace
shortly after his return, to which fifty harlots were
invited. After the supper they danced nude and
indulged in various performances, the Pope, Caesar,
and Lucretia looking on. Matarazzo also gives
an account of the bacchanalia, but slightly changed.
A description of it is likewise included in the letter
to Silvio Savelli, and this is repeated by Sanudo
in his diary.</p>

<p>August 20th the Pope had pronounced the ban
against the Colonna and the Savelli, and the confiscation
of their property, and shortly afterwards<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
by a bull, dated September 17th, he divided their
domains and the estates of the Gaetani, of the
Savelli, of the Estouteville, and of the barons of
Pojano and Magenza between the two Borgia
infants. Rodrigo, the two-year-old son of Lucretia
and the murdered Alfonso, received Sermoneta,
Ninfa, Norma, Albano, Nettuno, and Ardea; while
Giovanni was given Nepi, Palestrina, Paliano,
Rigano, and other cities. The Pope erected Nepi,
Sermoneta, and Palestrina into duchies, while
he bestowed Subiaco with its eighteen castles on
the Borgia family in perpetuity; the bull was
signed by all the cardinals then in Rome, nineteen
in number, among whom were Caraffa, Sanseverino,
Cesarini, Farnese, Palavicini, and Medici, not one
of them opposing this high-handed robbery of the
Ghibelline lords of Latium by the Pope for the
benefit of his own family—and with the help of
the funds and offices of the Church. Almost the
entire patrimony of St. Peter was now in the hands
of the Borgia, for Caesar controlled all of
Romagna.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a></p>

<p>In one bull the Pope describes Giovanni Borgia
as Caesar’s son, but in the second he calls him his
own “son by a certain woman”—this woman was
Giulia Bella. It would be difficult to believe such
effrontery possible if the bulls, both of which are
dated September 1, 1501, were not in existence
to prove it.</p>

<p>Negotiations for the marriage of Lucretia Borgia
and Alfonso d’Este had been in progress for some
time. It had become known that he was looking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
for a wife, and his Holiness immediately discerned
the advantages a union with the powerful House
of Ferrara would afford. Ferrara would serve as
a bulwark against the Venetians, who, the Pope
knew, had designs on Romagna. The Duke of
Ferrara was not very favourably disposed toward
a marriage with a Borgia, and when Alexander
suggested an alliance between his daughter
Lucretia and the Duke’s son Alfonso, Ercole
received the suggestion coldly. Moreover,
Louis XII. had partly promised to find him
a French princess for a wife for his son. Louis,
however, being more anxious to please the Pope
than any other Italian sovereign, had the Cardinal
of Rouen inform Ercole that he could look to him
for nothing. Lucretia had twice lost her husband
under tragic circumstances, and Alfonso himself
had little inclination for the match, while his sister
Isabella d’Este, wife of the Marquis of Mantua,
was bitterly opposed to the union upon which the
Pope’s heart was set. Alfonso and his father, however,
did not dare offend the Pope and Caesar,
so they determined to drive as good a bargain
as they could. The negotiations were wellnigh
interminable. At first Ercole merely demanded a
large dowry; then he insisted upon the remission
of four-fifths of the annual tribute due the Church,
and in addition he required the bishopric of Ferrara
for his son, Cardinal d’Este. The dowry was to
be 200,000 gold ducats, secured by liens on fiefs
in Romagna, and an agreement was finally reached.
In secret consistory, September 7th, all the
cardinals present had consented to the remission
of the Church’s tribute for the purpose of advancing
the family interests and political ambitions of
Alexander and Caesar Borgia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
Valentino had returned to Rome about the middle
of September, and the 23rd he received the envoys
of the Duke of Ferrara, who found him lying on
a bed, but dressed. October 6th they again had
occasion to confer with him, and they brought the
list of those who were to come to Rome to escort
the bride to Ferrara. Valentino was especially
gracious; the orators gave a detailed account of
their interview, because, as they explained, it was
a favour usually accorded only to cardinals. It
seems to have been difficult to obtain an audience
with Caesar; when the Ferrarese orators again
tried to see him two days later they were refused;
they complained to the Pope, who appeared greatly
annoyed, and said: “Caesar turns night into day,
and day into night; the ambassadors of Rimini
have been in Rome more than two months without
securing an audience.” They also reported that
Alexander was much displeased with Caesar’s
conduct, and that he remarked that he was not
certain that his Excellency would be able to hold
the conquered territory.</p>

<p>The preparations for the wedding were interrupted
for some days by the absence of the Pope
and Caesar, who, accompanied by a number of
cardinals and their suites, went to Civita Castellana
and Nepi to inspect the changes which had been
made in the stronghold of the latter place, and the
fortress which was being constructed in the former
town by Antonio di Sangallo.</p>

<p>During their absence Lucretia had been left as
regent in the Vatican, according to Burchard, just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
as she had been on a former occasion, with authority
to open letters and transact ecclesiastical business.</p>

<p>The escort which was expected to come to
conduct Lucretia to Ferrara was delayed several
times, and they were still looking for it at the
end of October; finally Ercole announced that,
owing to the inclemency of the season, he had
decided to postpone the matter; the true reason,
however, was the fact that the Emperor Maximilian
had given him to understand that the alliance with
the Borgia to which he had committed himself was
highly displeasing to himself.</p>

<p>It was at this time that the remarkable “Letter to
Silvio Savelli” was received in Rome; it was a
small book printed in Germany. Its author is
unknown, but it is supposed to have been written
by a Colonna. Savelli had been robbed of his
property by Alexander, and was an exile living
at the Court of Maximilian. Gregorovius remarks:
“This is an authentic document revealing the condition
of Rome under the Borgia; no other writing
so well exhibits the iniquity of these people, their
corrupt politics, in great as well as small affairs,
and the terror that ruled the city, which was filled
with their spies and cut-throats.”</p>

<p>The universal execration in which they were held
is also well revealed in the epigrams of the day, one
of the most famous of which is the <span class="locked">following:—</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“Vendit Alex. claves, altaria, christum,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Emerat ille prius, vendere jure potest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">De vitio in vitium, de flamma crescit in ignem,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Roma sub Hispano deperit Imperio.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sextus Tarquinius, Sextus Nero, Sextus et Iste.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Semper sub Sextis perdita Roma fuit.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
Alexander VI. read and enjoyed the letter to
Silvio Savelli, as he was used to these satires, but
Burchard remarks that Caesar regarded them more
seriously, and cites the case of the rhetorician
Jeronimo Mancini of Naples, who, having spoken
ill of the Duke, was seized, and suffered the loss
of the end of his tongue and a hand, which were
exposed at a window in the Curia S. Crucis for
two days. Some have ascribed the authorship of
the famous letter to Mancini. January 28, 1502,
a Venetian, who, it was said, had sent something
he had written against the Pope to Venice, was
seized, and when his ambassador went to intercede
for him that night, he was informed that the unfortunate
wretch had already been executed.
Costabili, the Ferrarese ambassador, when he spoke
to the Pope about the Duke’s vindictiveness, was
told by his Holiness, “The Duke is good, but he
cannot bear insults; and,” he added, “once when
I told him he should profit by my example and
let them write all the satires they wished, he became
angry, and exclaimed he would teach these
scribblers good manners.”</p>

<p>In the meantime Ercole d’Este, having no excuse
for further delay, dispatched the escort—December
7th—for Rome, where it arrived the 23rd. In
the cortège were Cardinal Ippolito and Fernando
d’Este, brothers of the groom, with their suites,
numbering more than five hundred persons.
Valentino, accompanied by the French ambassador,
Monseigneur de Trans, went to meet the princes.
He embraced the cardinal affectionately, and when
returning to the city rode on Ippolito’s left. At
the gates they were met by nineteen other cardinals<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
and their “families.” They were received by the
Pope and his Court in the Vatican, after which
Caesar conducted the princes to his sister’s apartments.
The wedding gifts were magnificent—the
least of all was that of Florence, a present of cloth
of gold and silver to the value of 3,000 ducats.
The betrothal took place December 28th, and the
church ceremony the 30th.</p>

<p>Burchard describes the wedding with a wealth
of detail that would do credit to a modern society
reporter; the gowns, the jewels, the presents, the
guests, the bride, the groom—all are there; the
games for the entertainment—all are described.</p>

<p>Another move in the great political game had
been made; the declining House of Naples had
been eliminated as a factor in the Borgia plans
by the murder of Alfonso of Aragon, and the
support of the great House of Este, secured by the
marriage of Ercole’s son, the future Duke of
Ferrara, with Lucretia, who was apparently a
passive instrument in the hands of Caesar and the
Pope in their machinations. The final historical
estimate of her is that she was not the virago, the
baneful fiend she is represented to have been, but a
colourless, characterless personality, wholly lacking
in will, and completely under the control of Caesar
and the Pope. She had none of the characteristics
of Caterina Sforza. She left Rome to go to her
future husband, who had been represented by a
proxy, and she never returned. She appears to
have made an excellent wife and mother.</p>

<p>Caesar remained in Rome until February 17,
1502, when he and the Pope, accompanied by
several cardinals, left for Piombino, where they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
arrived the 21st. On the 25th they sailed for Elba
to inspect two strongholds which Caesar was having
his engineers construct on the island. When they
were returning, March 1st, there was a severe
storm, which made it impossible for them to leave
the vessels for five days, and Burchard remarks
that the Pope and cardinals who were in the captain’s
ship were so frightened that they fell ill.
They did not succeed in getting back to Rome until
the 11th of March.</p>

<p>The strongholds on the island of Elba were probably
built by Leonardo da Vinci, who had left
Cesena in the fall of 1501 to go to Rome to confer
with Caesar, and not by Antonio di Sangallo, who
was engaged on the works in the vicinity of Civita
Castellana during the early months of 1502.</p>

<p>In October, Caesar had declared his intention of
attacking Camerino, but, owing to various causes,
had been compelled to defer his undertaking. We
have few details regarding Valentino during the
months which he spent in Rome, but the chroniclers
have left minute records of the administrative
measures of his lieutenants in the Romagna. The
petty States had been allowed to retain their own
laws and customs, and, so far as possible, their
own peculiar governmental systems; but all
officials were responsible to the Governor of
Romagna, Don Remiro de Lorca, an overbearing
martinet, feared and hated by every one.</p>

<p class="in0"><span class="pfirst">Caesar</span> was compelled to wait until the conclusion
of the Neapolitan campaign before he could
resume his own projects in the Romagna, where
there were a few independent lords still left—these
few knew that their time would soon come; among
them were the Varano of Camerino and the Duke
of Urbino, Guidobaldo di Montefeltre, who was
greatly beloved by his people.</p>

<p>To complete his conquest of Romagna, Caesar
determined to secure possession of Camerino,
Urbino, and Sinigaglia. The early months of 1502
had been occupied with the trips to Piombino, Elba,
and the towns belonging to the Colonna, and he
was obliged to remain in Rome until after the
Easter festivities; he was, therefore, unable to set
about the execution of his projects until June.</p>

<p>Shortly before his departure the body of the
youthful Lord of Faenza, who had so heroically<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
defended his domain, was found in the Tiber,
“strangled and dead.”</p>

<p>On surrendering to Caesar, Astorre’s life had
been spared, and he had been allowed to depart
with his personal belongings, and, as we have seen,
trusting in Valentino’s word, he had gone to Rome,
where he had almost immediately been thrown into
prison.</p>

<p>He was held in the Castle of St. Angelo almost
a year, and under date of June 9, 1502, Burchard
has the following entry in his <span class="locked">diary:—</span></p>

<p>“This day there was recovered from the Tiber,
strangled and dead, the Lord of Faenza—a young
man of about eighteen years, so fair, and handsome
of form that among a thousand scarcely could his
equal be found. A great stone was tied to his
neck.”</p>

<p>The same day the river gave up the bodies of
several other persons, among them two young men,
one fifteen, the other twenty-five, both bound, and
also a woman.</p>

<p>Vettori states that Manfredi perished at the hands
of Bianchino di Pisa by order of Caesar, who was
in Rome at the time. Manfredi was in the power
and possession of the Borgia at the time of his
death; consequently, whoever actually performed
the murder, Alexander VI. and Caesar Borgia were
responsible for it.</p>

<p>The murder of the Lord of Faenza shocked all
Italy, and served to strengthen the suspicion that
Valentino had caused the assassination of his
brother, the Duke of Gandia, and also of his
brother-in-law, Alfonso, Prince of Bisceglia.</p>

<p>Caesar’s motive is perfectly clear; he was determined<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
to rule in Romagna. Manfredi was magnetic
and brave, and skilful in war. His subjects had
fought valiantly to save him, and were broken-hearted
at his departure. Of all the petty
sovereigns of Italy, he was almost the only one
who enjoyed the love of his people, who continued
loyal to him and looked forward to his return.
In addition, his powerful kinsmen, the Este of
Ferrara and the Bentivoglio of Bologna, might take
it into their heads any day to restore him to power.
Manfredi dead, Caesar’s progress would be easier
and more certain. In spite of Valentino’s able
administration of the government of Faenza, he
had utterly failed to secure the goodwill of the
people. Faenza was the least certain of his conquered
territories. Before setting out to attack
Camerino and Urbino it was, according to Caesar,
the part of wisdom to eliminate Astorre from the
desperate game which the virtuosi of renascent
Italy were playing.</p>

<p>This deliberate planning of the destruction of a
prince or a reigning family, for the sole purpose
of securing possession of their property or power,
seems peculiarly monstrous.</p>

<p>Caesar Borgia, aided by his father, Alexander VI.,
was building up a great power in central Italy for
himself and his family, of which he clearly regarded
himself as the head. Politics, parties, and dynasties,
although apparently of vital importance to a
people, are now really of slight moment, and it is
only when the headstrong exercise of power leads
to oppression that a people revolts. In the Far
East the people are wholly indifferent to a change
of rulers, consequently conquests in Asia are as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
easy as they are fruitless; the people pursue the
even tenor of their way regardless of who their
masters are, except so far as their economic situation
is concerned—and the people of Italy during
the Renaissance resembled them in this particular.
We have seen how ready the cities of the Romagna
were to open their gates to Caesar Borgia, and the
same phenomenon has been noted elsewhere in the
peninsula. In Naples whether France or Spain
prevailed was of no importance. In Milan the
people were equally indifferent to Ludovico il Moro
and to Louis XII., and in Florence not until the
greed of the Medici passed all bounds did the
people drive them out. With advancing civilisation
party lines vanish; one party usurps the principles
of another, and modifies them sufficiently to cause
them to appear to accord, or be identical, with its
own doctrines; and just in proportion as party lines
disappear the one enduring relation which has
existed from all time, the relation of exploiter and
exploited, stands forth more clearly—in fine, the
whole organisation of civilised society is reducible
to the hedonic postulate.</p>

<p>Caesar had collected an army in the neighbourhood
of Spoleto, and thither he went June 12, 1502.
His forces consisted of about 10,000 men—6,000
foot-soldiers, and 700 men-at-arms; in addition he
had about 2,000 men conveniently placed in
Romagna. Large bodies of troops were likewise
held in reserve about Sinigaglia, Urbino, and Verruchio.
Valentino had issued an order requiring
every family in Romagna to furnish one man-at-arms.
Resorting to cunning, he then announced
that he intended to attack Camerino, and he went to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
the Duke of Urbino and asked for his artillery for
his lieutenant, Vitelli; he also requested him to send
supplies to Gubbio, assuring Montefeltre the while
that “among all the princes of Italy there is none
more dear to me than you are.” While he was
advancing by way of Nocera and Costaciaro, he
dispatched 2,000 men to secure Cagli, which they
entered June 20th without resistance. There was
nothing left for the Duke of Urbino’s representative
to do but to warn his master of the advance of
Valentino, “who will appear as an enemy before
the gates of Urbino on the morrow.”</p>

<p>The Duke of Urbino was so confident that Caesar
had no designs on his domain that he had gone
to one of his suburban villas for a brief sojourn,
and he was still there when his representative at
Fossombrone informed him of the advance of a
large force by way of Isola di Fano. Montefeltre,
learning that the roads leading to the fortress of
San Leo, which was regarded as impregnable, were
already in Caesar’s possession, determined to flee
to Florence. With him he had only a few servants
and soldiers, whom he soon dismissed, and disguising
himself as a peasant, he fled to Mantua,
where he arrived about the end of the month.</p>

<p>Just four hours after the flight of Montefeltre,
who was entirely unable to count on any support on
the part of his people, Caesar entered Urbino, and
all the officials of the place immediately repaired to
him to pay their respects.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
No sooner was Valentino installed in the beautiful
palace of Urbino than he dispatched Pedro de
Oviedo to Florence to demand the person of the
Duke of Urbino, who, he had reason to believe,
was within her borders, and to ask what her intentions
were with respect to himself. To this the
Signory replied by sending an embassy consisting
of the Bishop, Francesco Soderini, and a secretary,
the astute Machiavelli, who, however, after two
interviews with Valentino, returned to report to the
Signory.</p>

<p>The envoys on their first meeting with Caesar
lost whatever illusions they may have had concerning
his intentions regarding Florence. Valentino
complained that the Florentines had shown a want
of faith towards him; but notwithstanding this he
was desirous of forming an alliance with the Republic,
and it was for this that he had requested
that plenipotentiaries be sent him; and to make
sure that there would be no violation of faith, he
demanded that the government of the city be
changed and a new one established upon whose
word he could rely, “otherwise,” he remarked to
the two envoys, “you will very soon understand
that I will not long endure the present state of
affairs, and if you do not wish to have me for a
friend you shall have me for an enemy.” The
envoys endeavoured to excuse the Republic’s breach
of faith, and assured the Duke that she only desired
his friendship. As to a change in the government
they replied that the city had the best government
that could be found; but Caesar insisted,
and regretting that this was not that for which
they supposed they had been summoned, and was
not what the city expected, they took their leave.
In one of their dispatches the envoys stated that
Caesar was <i xml:lang="it" lang="it">molto solitario e segreto</i>—very solitary
and secret. Valentino informed them that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
he had no desire to seize the property of any one—that
it was not his purpose to make himself a tyrant,
but, on the contrary, to drive out the tyrants.</p>

<p>Machiavelli alluded to the fate of the Duke of
Urbino, “whose death had been announced simultaneously
with the disease,” to which Caesar replied,
“that the fate of Urbino showed the rapidity with
which he reached his goal.”</p>

<p>Caesar literally dazzled and disarmed the envoys
with his dash and cunning and effrontery, and
Machiavelli wrote: “This lord is splendid and
magnificent, and in the profession of arms his boldness
is such that the greatest undertakings present
no difficulties for him; when he sets out to acquire
glory and enlarge his domains, he knows neither
rest, fatigue, nor danger; his arrival in a place is no
sooner known than he is gone; he understands how
to win the love of his men, and he has the best
troops in all Italy—and this circumstance, together
with most extraordinary good luck, makes him a
conqueror and a formidable adversary.” In one
of his dispatches Soderini says: “It is difficult
to answer him, so numerous are his arguments, and
his speech and wit so ready.”</p>

<p>The negotiations, however, were protracted, and
Machiavelli returned to Florence, while his colleague
remained to divert Caesar, so that the
Republic might have time to appeal to France.
July 6th a messenger arrived from Louis XII., who
commanded Caesar not to molest Florence; his
Majesty also stated that he would regard any
act of violence against the Republic as an affront
to himself. The King’s action had been taken
at the request of the Signory, who thus wished to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
show Valentino that they enjoyed the favour of
France. In the meantime Caesar’s unchecked captains
continued their aggressions by seizing
Anghiari and Borgo San Sepolcro. July 9th the
orator in Urbino informed the Duke that his
Government would enter into an alliance with him,
but demanded that he order Vitellozzo Vitelli to
withdraw from Florentine territory. To this Caesar
would not consent until an agreement had been
reached, but to show his goodwill he proposed a
suspension of hostilities. The Florentines, however,
having been informed that the King of France with
20,000 men was on the way to Italy, procrastinated.
They answered that while they would be glad to
please him they would first have to consult with
his Majesty. Soderini was directed to prolong the
negotiations as much as possible to give the French
lancers time to reach the field of action. After
considerable fencing the envoy took leave of
Valentino July 19th.</p>

<p>It appears that Caesar had already added to his
numerous titles that of Duke of Urbino—“the weak
State,” which he regarded as of slight importance,
and in whose beautiful palace he found numerous
works of art, which he caused to be removed to
Cesena, not the least valuable of the treasures
being the famous library. Among the statues was
Michael Angelo’s “Cupid,” which Caesar himself
a few years before, when still a cardinal,
had presented to Guidobaldo di Montefeltre.
Isabella d’Este, after Caesar’s occupation of Urbino,
having expressed a desire for this work of art, and
for a certain “Venus,” the Duke sent them to her,
although when she had asked her brother Ippolito<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
to procure them for her, she had explained that
“she did not wish to have anything to do with
the Duke of Romagna.” Isabella had supposed the
“Cupid” to be antique, but Caesar informed her
that it was the work of Michael Angelo. Writing
to her husband, Isabella said: “I will not describe
the beauty of the ‘Venus,’ as I think you have
seen it, but the ‘Cupid’ has no equal among modern
works.”</p>

<p>No sooner had Soderini departed than Caesar,
disguised and accompanied by only four servants,
also left the city, intending to go secretly to the
King of France in Milan. Just as he was about to
take horse envoys arrived to congratulate him on
the fall of Camerino, which had surrendered to
his lieutenants July 19th.</p>

<p>The Varano family were the overlords of
Camerino, and their head, Giulio Cesare, a man of
seventy, who had been a condottiere in the pay
of Venice, was one of the tyrants Valentino had
singled out for destruction. Pope Alexander, on
the ground that the Varano had neglected to pay
the tribute due the Church, had at the time of
Caesar’s first successes declared their States confiscated.
Early in June Valentino had dispatched
two of his captains, the Duke of Gravina and
Oliverotto da Fermo, from Rome to take possession
of Camerino. Giulio Cesare Varano had sent his
two younger sons to Venice for aid, and had kept
the two elder with him in Camerino. There they
made some resistance, but their relations with their
subjects were similar to those of most of the Italian
tyrants with their people, consequently they found
but lukewarm support; there was even one faction,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
composed of their most determined adversaries, who
were anxious to open the gates to Valentino’s
lieutenants. Giulio Cesare Varano and his two sons
were taken to Urbino and cast into prison. The
Colonna, who had assisted in the defence of
Camerino, succeeded in making their escape.
July 20th Caesar informed his sister Lucretia of
the capture of Camerino in the following <span class="locked">letter:—</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Illustrious and most excellent Lady, and our
dear sister. Knowing that in your present illness
no medicine could be more efficacious and more
helpful than the announcement of good news, we
inform you that we have just received a reliable
report to the effect that Camerino has been taken.
We beg you to honour this message with an
immediate amelioration in your health and to
inform us of it; for, distressed as we are, knowing
you are so ill, nothing, not even this happy event,
can give us any pleasure. We beg you to communicate
this present news to the Illustrious Sr.
Don Alfonso, your husband and our dearly beloved
brother-in-law, to whom I cannot write to-day.
Urbino XX July MDII.</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="l3">“<span class="smcap">Caesar</span></span><br />
<span class="smcap">“Agapito.</span>”
</p></blockquote>

<p>Valentino always maintained friendly relations
with Ercole and Alfonso d’Este, who never
neglected to congratulate him on his successes.</p>

<p>Caesar evidently was anxious regarding his
sister’s health, for he sent a famous physician of
Cesena, Niccolò Marsini, to consult with his own
physician, Gaspare Torrella, who had been
previously dispatched to Ferrara. A few days
later Caesar, disguised and with only a small suite,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
went to see his sister; he remained only two hours
with her, and then, accompanied by his brother-in-law
Alfonso, set out for Milan to meet the King
of France.</p>

<p>Louis had been informed of their coming, but
had kept the matter secret from the numerous
deposed princes who had hastened to him. To
the astonishment of the entire Court, which included
the Duke of Urbino, the Lord of Pesaro, Varano
of Camerino, and the Marquis of Mantua, who
had offered to place himself at the head of a league
for the purpose of dispossessing Caesar of his
domains, the King received the new-comers most
cordially. The courtiers had supposed that Louis
would undertake to discipline Valentino for
threatening Florence, but instead he received
Caesar and his brother-in-law with the highest
honours. The dethroned princes therefore immediately
divined that the King and the Vatican were
in perfect accord. Louis needed the Pope’s support
in his plans with respect to Naples, and Caesar
was astute enough to know that his Majesty would
not seriously interfere with his own projects.</p>

<p>About this time Louis XII. and Valentino entered
into a formal agreement regarding Bologna, by
which his Majesty promised to furnish the Duke
with three hundred lances “to help him to conquer
Bologna in the name of the Church and subdue
the Orsini, the Baglioni, and the Vitelli,” while
Caesar promised to hold himself in readiness for
three years to assist the King in any enterprises
in which he might see fit to engage.</p>

<p>On returning from Milan Caesar immediately—September
10th—went to Imola to meet Cardinal
Borgia, Bishop of Elne, and Don Remiro de Lorca,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
Governor of Romagna. Leonardo da Vinci had
just completed his inspection of the Romagnol
stronghold and castles, and had drawn up plans
for strengthening them; he had also made designs
for certain engines of war. Caesar remained in
Imola until the 16th conferring with his lieutenants.
In the meantime Alexander had sent an envoy to
Bologna to demand that Giovanni Bentivoglio submit
to his authority. At this juncture Claude de
Seyssel, ambassador of Louis XII.—who had
returned to France—appeared in Bologna to make
known the wishes of his master, who had always
regarded himself as the protector of the city. The
Bentivoglio were loyally supported by the citizens,
who refused to allow Giovanni’s sons, who had
been summoned to the Vatican, to go to Rome;
and the political parties, which had divided
Bologna, laid aside their differences in the face
of the threatening danger.</p>

<p>The Bolognese had found allies in Caesar’s own
camp. The Orsini, the Baglioni, and Vitellozzo
Vitelli had become estranged from him by his treatment
of Bentivoglio and his efforts to compel Vitelli
to surrender Milan to Florence. The condottieri,
in Caesar’s name, had entered into an alliance of
friendship with Bentivoglio during the last campaign;
it therefore is not surprising that they
refused to break this treaty and finally took sides
with the House of Bologna against him.</p>

<p>Caesar was now isolated, and his only support
was the small army of Romagna, which was not
sufficient to permit him to attack Bologna; nevertheless,
counting on the French lances which the
King had promised him at Milan, he prepared to
make an assault upon the city.</p>

<p class="in0"><span class="pfirst">Caesar’s</span> preparations for attacking Milan were the
signal for the final rupture with his captains, who
met at Todi, where they had concentrated their
troops. Here they entered into a formal agreement
to refuse to obey any of Caesar’s orders
directed against their ally Giovanni Bentivoglio.
The first meeting was held about the end of September,
and a second one took place a little later
at Magione, near Perugia. Those present were
Ermes and Annibale Bentivoglio, Cardinal Orsini,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
the Duke of Gravina, two other members of the
Orsini family, Guido Petrucci (who also represented
Pandolfo Petrucci), and Gentile and Giampaolo
Baglioni. Vitellozzo Vitelli, who was ill, had himself
carried to the meeting on a litter. At this
meeting of the conspirators it was resolved not only
to refuse to attack Bentivoglio but also to take
active steps against Caesar, their former commander.</p>

<p>October 2nd news of the conspiracy reached the
Vatican. In the north Bentivoglio was advancing
on Imola; in the south the Orsini and Vitelli were
preparing to attack Urbino. Caesar was in Imola
awaiting the arrival of the French lances, and there
he learned of the revolt of his lieutenants. The
loss of the Orsini was especially serious, and he
endeavoured to win them over from the conspirators.
In the meantime he sent out agents to
enlist new troops. As soon as the condition of
affairs became known soldiers of fortune hastened
to him from all directions; among the first to
appear were Gasparo Sanseverino, Luigi della
Mirandola, Galeazzo Palavicini, Raffaelle de’ Pazzi,
Ranieri della Sassetta, and Francesco de Luna.
The Romagnols hurried to his assistance, and he
placed them under the command of his ablest
leaders, Dionigi di Naldo, Marc Antonio di Fano,
Gabrielle da Faenza, Guido di Vaini, and Giovanni
Sassatelli. To his Spanish captains he entrusted
the command of the cities and strongholds, upon
which the security of his new duchy depended.</p>

<p>In the meantime the Pope had used his influence
with Giulio Orsini, who was now ready to desert
Vitelli, while Pandolfo Petrucci, dismayed by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
preparations Caesar was making to crush his
enemies, dispatched a messenger to Imola to assure
his former commander of his loyalty.</p>

<p>To secure the support of Florence Caesar now
requested the Republic to send an ambassador to
him to confer on matters of mutual interest, and
again the envoy selected was Machiavelli.</p>

<p>No other man was so well fitted as he to read
the devious mind of Valentino; he had given
evidence of the greatest perspicacity and shrewdness,
and if any one was a match for the son of
Alexander VI. the Florentine secretary was. Not
only his friends the Adriani, the Soderini, the
Valori, but even his opponents approved of the
selection. Machiavelli accepted his commission
eagerly; he was naturally restless and was intensely
interested in the political life of the day.
He had met Caesar a few months before, and he
regarded him as the Italian ideal, a personification
of <i xml:lang="it" lang="it">virtu</i>, the aggregation of the qualities most
dear to the Italian heart; it is therefore not
surprising that he eagerly embraced the opportunity
to study Valentino and match wits with him.</p>

<p>Machiavelli having promised his young wife,
Marietta di Ludovico Corsini, whom he had married
but a few months before, that he would return
in eight days, set out for Imola. On the road
he met Agapito Gerardino, Caesar’s secretary, on
his way to Florence to ask aid of the Signory.
The Pope also, foreseeing the danger, had dispatched
an envoy to the Republic. Caesar’s secretary
decided to turn back and accompany Machiavelli
to Imola, where they arrived October 7th.</p>

<p>Machiavelli explained to Valentino that he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
come to assure him of the friendship of the Republic
and to inform him that it had refused to join his
enemies. Valentino received the envoy cordially,
and thanked him for the professions of friendship
on the part of his Government. They discussed
the political situation at great length, and Caesar
appeared very anxious to conclude some sort of
an agreement with Florence for their mutual
support, but Machiavelli was unable to get any very
definite suggestion from the Duke. The Borgia,
who was then only twenty-six, showed himself a
consummate diplomatist and more than a match
for the Florentine secretary.</p>

<p>October 9th Machiavelli had another interview
with Caesar, who, to strengthen the demands he
had made for an alliance with Florence, produced
a letter from the King of France in which aid was
promised for the undertaking against Bologna.
Valentino seemed much elated. “Now, you see,
secretary, this letter is an answer to my request
for permission to attack Bologna.”</p>

<p>Machiavelli did not allow himself to be deceived
by Caesar’s astuteness and eloquence, but he carefully
weighed the causes for the Duke’s confidence
in the success of his projects; he estimated his
actual military strength and the number of troops
he could collect, and he found that Caesar was
far from weak, but also that his enemies were much
more powerful than he had represented them to be.</p>

<p>The Florentine was greatly impressed by Valentino’s
astuteness, but he was, nevertheless, able to
discern his real purpose. Caesar had boldly stated
that if he effected a reconciliation with the Orsini
it would be impossible for him to enter into any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
treaty of friendship with their enemy Florence, and
Machiavelli knew that this was true, consequently
he wrote the Signory that it would be well to make
some sort of compact with the Duke at once.</p>

<p>Machiavelli’s first impressions of Caesar were
vague and uncertain. The Duke was not more
perspicacious than the secretary, but he had greater
self-control, had a sharper insight into motives,
and he possessed powers of dissimulation which
Machiavelli entirely lacked. Above all else Caesar
was perfect master of himself. He therefore succeeded
in hiding much of his real purpose from
the secretary.</p>

<p>The Signory of Florence, however, attached the
greatest importance to Machiavelli’s report of his
interviews with Caesar, and Valori wrote him,
October 11th, saying his “relation was clear cut,
exact, and sincere—and to be relied upon.”</p>

<p>Among the conspirators it had been decided that
Bentivoglio should attack Romagna, while the
Orsini and Vitelli should try to take Urbino. Some
of the leaders had hesitated and the plan was still
in abeyance when an unexpected event gave them
new courage.</p>

<p>The Castle of San Leo, the bulwark of Urbino,
was seized by a supporter of the Montefeltre early
in October, and Caesar had been informed of the
fact before Machiavelli reached Imola. Valentino
was not disturbed by the news, and the Florentine
envoy says that he expressed his pity for those
who had chosen such an unfavourable moment to
attack him; he made light of the loss of a State
he had no intention of retaining; he could recover
it any time he saw fit. He even showed Machiavelli<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
copies of the orders he had sent his lieutenants
to retire within their lines of defence.</p>

<p>These commanders, Ugo Moncada, Michelotto
de Corella, Bartolomeo Capranica, and Giovanni
de Cordova, retreated, but destroyed the villages
that lay in their way, delivering them over to fire
and pillage. Pergola and Fossombrone were laid
waste and all their inhabitants, men, women, and
children, put to the sword. The news of these
crimes reached Imola October 12th, and Caesar
exultingly exclaimed to Machiavelli, “The stars this
year seem to be unfavourable to rebels!”</p>

<p>One after another the towns in Urbino revolted,
but still the conspirators hesitated. Paolo Orsini
announced that he would return to Caesar if he
would relinquish his intention of attacking Bologna
and direct his energies against Florence; Vitelli,
at first the most active of the conspirators, now
offered to follow Valentino if he would assure him
of his safety. That all Italy was afraid of Caesar
and the Pope there is no doubt.</p>

<p>The Duke pretended to believe in the sincerity
of his captains and received them again into his
favour; he even dispatched them to the support
of the garrisons in Urbino that were still loyal
to him. Vitelli had advanced as far as Castel-Durante,
and the Baglioni were at Cagli. The
Orsini were in the neighbourhood of the stronghold
of San Leo, holding aloof from both Caesar and
Montefeltre, who had taken refuge in Venice, where
he had recruited a considerable number of troops.
October 12th a courier arrived in Urbino with the
news that Montefeltre was advancing to the aid
of the garrison. This meant that Venice was helping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
the conspirators, who consequently again took
heart and threw off the mask. The 15th the Orsini,
who had apparently been willing to return to
Caesar, fell upon the troops of Ugo Moncada and
made him prisoner. Michelotto was forced to flee
to Fossombrone, and a few days later the Duke
of Urbino again entered his capital.</p>

<p>Had the conspirators with their united forces
attacked Caesar at this moment, it is highly
probable that he would have lost the greater part
of his domain; but each appeared to be concerned
only with his own interests and much time was
lost by remaining inactive in Urbino. Finally the
rebels began to be suspicious of each other.
Giampaolo Baglioni, knowing that Fano was
Caesar’s most loyal town, asked permission to enter
as his lieutenant. Pandolfo Petrucci of Perugia
had always hesitated because he feared the Borgia
would finally outwit the conspirators; and a few
days after the return of the Duke of Urbino he
sent a messenger to suggest in the name of all
that a new treaty or agreement be made by which
they would again enter his service and recover the
territory which had been lost.</p>

<p>Louis XII., unable to accomplish his purpose
with respect to Naples without the help of Alexander
VI., declared those who opposed the Holy
Father’s plans regarding the Romagna were also
his enemies. The King had promptly discovered
the part Venice had played in effecting the return of
Montefeltre to Urbino, consequently he threatened
the Republic with his wrath in case it lent any
further aid whatsoever to the enemies of Valentino;
this again strengthened Caesar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
Furnished with a safe conduct from Valentino,
Paolo Orsini came to Imola October 20th, and the
terms of a reconciliation having been arranged, he
was allowed to depart unharmed a few days later.
All were to be forgiven, and Caesar agreed to protect
the estate of each of his lieutenants, and in return
they were to defend him and his territory and those
of the Pope, and, theoretically at least, also those
of all the princes of the House of Borgia. There
was to be a special agreement regarding Bologna,
and Cardinal Orsini, Pandolfo Petrucci, and Valentino
himself were chosen to arrange the terms.</p>

<p>Machiavelli heard Caesar’s confidant, Agapito of
Amelia, laugh at the conspirators and speak of
them as rebels after the compact had been signed—“a
child would laugh at such a treaty.” In Rome,
too, the agreement was not regarded very seriously.</p>

<p>Only a short time elapsed between Paolo Orsini’s
departure from Imola and his arrival in Urbino,
where he informed Vitelli of the terms of the agreement
he had signed in the name of the conspirators
with Valentino. In the meantime Vitelli had been
very active; he had aided the Duke of Urbino in
every way possible; he had attacked Caesar’s lieutenants,
and had even put some of his civil officers
to death. Oliverotto da Fermo, another of the conspirators,
had been equally active and Baglioni had
not been idle. Romagna, however, had remained
faithful to Caesar.</p>

<p>Vitelli rejected Caesar’s offer and persuaded
Baglioni also to join him in supporting the Duke
of Urbino. The situation, however, was serious.
Caesar was frequently heard to remark that he
was “eating the artichoke leaf by leaf.” Having<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
detached Petrucci and Orsini from the band of conspirators,
he endeavoured to win over Bentivoglio.
Finally an agreement was reached with the Lord
of Bologna and the treaty was signed in Rome by
his representative, Francesco Parato and the Pope’s
chamberlain, Michele Romolino. Giovanni Bentivoglio
had been left to his fate by the conspirators,
and when he entered into the treaty with the
Vatican he was acting solely in his own interests
without regard to any of the others. The treaty,
whose purpose was to assure the integrity of the
domain of the two parties, was signed in the
Vatican November 23rd. The King of France, the
Duke of Ferrara, and the Signory of Florence stood
sponsors for the alliance. Bologna agreed to
furnish Valentino a hundred men-at-arms and two
hundred light cavalry “for one or two enterprises
the Duke was planning.” In addition Caesar was
engaged by Bologna as a condottiere at an annual
salary of 12,000 ducats. The treaty was finally
signed November 23rd and was sent to Caesar
for ratification.</p>

<p>Giustinian, the Venetian ambassador, in his dispatch
of that date reports that he had heard that
Cardinal Orsini and the Bolognese envoy had
engaged in a violent altercation in the presence of
the Pope, the former charging Bentivoglio’s representative
with endeavouring to effect an agreement
with Caesar and the Vatican without regard to the
Orsini.</p>

<p>Vitellozzo Vitelli, finding himself deserted,
hastened to accept the terms offered him in
Caesar’s name by Paolo Orsini, who, bringing the
agreement signed by all the conspirators, arrived<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
in Imola November 27th, before Valentino had
formally ratified the treaty between Bologna and
the Pope. Two days later Orsini set out for Fano
to assume command of the troops and advance on
Urbino. He was accompanied by Antonio del
Monte, Valentino’s special commissioner for the city
of Urbino, bearing letters of amnesty for the rebels,
and delegated to take possession of the duchy in
the name of his master.</p>

<p>His recent comrades having sworn to recover
Urbino, Guidobaldo di Montefeltre gave himself
up for lost. In vain some of his loyal subjects
urged him to resist; at Valbona the women offered
him their jewels to procure means to secure troops
and supplies, but he decided to flee. Before doing
so he had the strongholds of Pergola and Cagli
razed. Early in December Paolo Orsini entered
the domain of the Montefeltre and, halting a few
miles from Urbino, sent a messenger to ask for
an interview with Guidobaldo, who was suffering
from an attack of the gout and had to be borne
on a litter to the place of meeting. December 7th
he took leave of such of his subjects as had
remained faithful, and two days later Paolo Orsini
entered Urbino and assumed the office of Governor
of the domain of the Montefeltre, although the
four strongest castles in the territory, San Leo,
Maggiolo, Montecuccolo, and San Marino were still
held by Vitelli, who, notwithstanding the fact that
he had signed the agreement with Caesar, still
seemed to be hesitating as to his course.</p>

<p>December 10th Valentino departed for Forli and
from there he went to Cesena, where he made
preparations to go to Rome by way of Ancona.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
It had been decided to make war on Sinigaglia,
Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere having failed to
convince the Pope and the King that he had not
aided Guidobaldo di Montefeltre in the last rebellion.
The Cardinal exerted himself to save his
nephew’s estates but failed.</p>

<p>The day before Caesar left Cesena for Pesaro
a terrible sight met the eyes of the peasants as
they entered the town in the early morning bringing
supplies. Thrown in the public square was a bleeding
and headless corpse clothed in a rich costume;
near by, impaled on a pike, was the head, which
the inhabitants of the capital of Romagna immediately
recognised as that of their Governor, Don
Remiro de Lorca. One of Caesar’s political
maxims was: leniency for small offenders, severity
for great ones. Numerous charges of malfeasance
in office—among others that of having sold for his
own profit grain which Valentino had imported—had
been made against the Governor and he had
been tried “to satisfy justice and our honour, and
that of those he had injured—and as a salutary
example for all public officials present and to
come,” condemned, and executed.</p>

<p>Machiavelli, who saw the body exposed in the
public square, observes: “It is not clearly known
what was the cause of his death—unless it was
simply the pleasure of the prince, who shows that
he knows how to make and unmake men according
to their deserts.” There were rumours, however,
that Don Remiro had been plotting with
Caesar’s enemies.</p>

<p>The 29th of the month, while in Fano, which
had remained faithful to him, Valentino received<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
a delegation from the citizens of Ancona, who had
come to assure him of their loyalty. With them
was a messenger from Vitelli, bringing news of the
capture of Sinigaglia, after a feeble resistance, about
the end of December, 1502.</p>

<p>Caesar’s commanders, to prove their good faith,
had not only offered their services for his movement
against Sinigaglia but several of them had
gone there in person. Paolo Orsini and his son
Fabio, Francesco Orsini, Duke of Gravina, and
Oliverotto da Fermo were there, and Vitellozzo
Vitelli and one of his nephews appeared on the
30th. The only ones absent were Giampaoli Baglioni,
who, distrustful of Caesar, had sent him word
from Perugia that he was ill; and Giulio Orsini,
who was in Rome under the protection of the all-powerful
head of the house, Cardinal Orsini.</p>

<p>How astute men, living in an age of unparalleled
duplicity, when every man’s hand was against
his neighbour, when treachery and assassination
were regarded as fine arts, and poison and poignard
perfectly proper tools in political machinations,
could have rushed into such a trap is difficult to
understand. Caesar’s character was known to all
of them; he was more than a match for any one
of them in cunning, intellect, astuteness, determination,
and what is of still more importance, he had
even less moral sense; he had frequently shown
that mercy, compassion, pity, were no part of his
nature, and these men, having betrayed him, conspired
to destroy him, ruin him, rob him of the
estates he regarded as his own, deliberately placed
themselves in his power! It would not have been
surprising if one or two had been deceived, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
there were seven or eight; in fact, there was only
one, Baglioni, who had not fallen into the trap.</p>

<p>The only explanation is that the conspirators were
utterly panic-stricken; they found their coalition
was gradually being weakened by Valentino—in
fact, that he was “eating the artichoke leaf by
leaf” as he said—and that they were doomed;
they perhaps thought that by surrendering and
again entering his employ there would be at least
a chance of being forgiven; with many men this
would have been the case, but they had failed to
grasp what was perhaps Caesar’s chief characteristic,
his utter implacability, which, in conjunction
with his extraordinary powers of dissimulation,
made him the most dangerous of the Italian
despots. All the members of his own family, not
excepting his father, the Pope, feared him. He
possessed all the characteristics of all the other
Italian condottieri but in a more highly developed
form. Caesar immediately saw that the hour for
vengeance had arrived—all the rebels were together.</p>

<p>The conspirators informed the Duke that the
territory had surrendered to them, but that the
stronghold still held out because, as the warder
said, he would relinquish it only to the Duke in
person.</p>

<p>The 30th of December Caesar sent them word
from Fano that he would be in Sinigaglia the next
day with the artillery to reduce the castle in case
it still refused to yield.</p>

<p>December 31st the army left Fano with Don
Michele and two hundred lances in the van, followed
by Caesar with the men-at-arms. When they
reached the bridge crossing the Misa just before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
Sinigaglia, Don Michele halted the light horse to
allow the infantry to pass and enter the town.</p>

<p>Oliverotto da Fermo had remained in the city,
but Paolo and Francesco Orsini and Vitellozzo
Vitelli, who had taken possession of some of the
neighbouring castles, came to meet Caesar, who
received them graciously, shook hands with them
in the “French fashion” and kissed them. According
to Machiavelli, seeing that Oliverotto was not
with them, Caesar made a sign to Michele to go and
find him, which he did and told him to come with
him to Caesar.</p>

<p>Valentino entered Sinigaglia on horseback, riding
between Vitellozzo Vitelli and Francesco Orsini, and
on arriving at the palace the four prepared to take
leave of him, but he asked them to go in with
him to confer—or perhaps to have luncheon. This
they did, but no sooner had they passed the portals
than they were seized by Valentino’s guard. The
accounts differ in some unimportant details but the
above is the generally accepted one.</p>

<p>That evening when Machiavelli reached Sinigaglia
he found the streets filled with soldiers and
the place in a tumult. As he was about to enter
the palace he saw the Duke come forth, armed
from head to foot, mounted on his charger. Caesar
called the Ambassador to him and told him of the
arrest of the Orsini and Vitelli. The Florentine
secretary was dazzled by this masterpiece of
treachery which he described as <i xml:lang="it" lang="it">il bellissimo
inganno</i>—“the most beautiful piece of deception.”</p>

<p>When news of the capture reached the troops
of Vitelli and Orsini they at once realised their
danger, and rallying about Fabio Orsini and Vitelli’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
nephew, withdrew from the town. Encountering
no further opposition, Caesar’s men overran the
place, robbing, plundering, violating, until he himself
issued from the palace with a guard and hanged
a number of the rioters in the public square.</p>

<p>Caesar decided to take Orsini to Rome, while
Oliverotto and Vitelli were condemned to death after
a semblance of a trial, the Duke apparently desiring
to give his action an appearance of right. The
order was given for them to be executed the same
night. It is related that the youthful and proud
Oliverotto tried to stab himself to avoid the shame
of death at the hands of the executioner. As to
Vitelli—“in his last hour he showed himself unworthy
of his past life, for he begged to be allowed
to plead with the Pope for forgiveness—and
Oliverotto turned his back on him.” At the tenth
hour of the night they were strangled.</p>

<p>Immediately after the execution Caesar wrote all
his friends among the Italian princes telling them
what he had done; his officers had conspired to
destroy him, and although he had forgiven them
they had met at Sinigaglia expressly for the purpose
of again entering into a compact to secure his
overthrow; having learned of this, he himself had
gone to that place with his troops and seized the
traitors, who had been duly tried and condemned.
The letter to Venice concludes with the remark,
“I am certain your Serenità will be pleased.” To
the Romagnols he wrote: “All the world ought
to be pleased, and especially Italy, seeing that by
their death the country is relieved of a dangerous
pest,” and he urges them to “thank God for
putting an end to the calamities the country suffered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
owing to these misguided ones,” who, it may be
observed, had until recently been among his most
capable commanders.</p>

<p>Many of the princes congratulated Caesar, and
Isabella d’Este sent him a present of some masks,
and in her letter referred to the “favourable
progress you are making.”</p>

<p>During the night of January 2, 1503, news was
brought the Pope of the capture of Sinigaglia, and
the next morning he sent a messenger to Cardinal
Orsini to inform him that he desired his presence.</p>

<p>According to the Master of Ceremonies, when
the cardinal and his suite reached the apostolic
palace their horses and mules were led away to
the Pope’s stables, and when Orsini entered the
Chamber of the Papagalli he found himself
surrounded by armed men and—says Burchard—was
frightened.</p>

<p>The Prothonotary Orsini, Bernardino d’Alviano,
brother of the condottiere Bartolomeo, Santa Croce,
a supporter of the Orsini, and Rinaldo Orsini,
Archbishop of Florence, were arrested at the same
time. Santa Croce, however, having promised that
he would appear when wanted and given bonds,
was set at liberty, but Cardinal Orsini was thrown
into prison in the Castle of St. Angelo, and the
Governor of Rome took possession of his palace
and personal property.</p>

<p>January 3rd the Holy Father informed the
Signory of Florence of what had taken place at
Sinigaglia and in Rome, and the following day
he told Giustinian that Caesar’s commanders and
Remiro de Lorca, Governor of Romagna, had conspired
to destroy him, and that this was the reason
Remiro had been executed at Cesena.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
A few days later nearly the entire Sacred College
went to the Pope to ask him to release their
colleague Cardinal Orsini, but the Holy Father
insisted that he had been the very heart and soul
of the conspiracy and refused to accede to their
wishes; he also justified Caesar’s action and
showed that he regarded the terrible vengeance he
had wrecked on his condottieri as a brilliant stroke
of genius.</p>

<p>Giustinian gives particulars of the plundering of
Cardinal Orsini’s palace. “Everything, even to
the straw, was carried away and taken to the
Vatican. A vast quantity of silver vessels was
found there—estimated to be worth more than
10,000 ducats—the most beautiful tapestries and
other household furniture—of money it is not known
how much, but it is said to have been less than
had been at first supposed. The cardinal’s mother
was dragged from the house with only what she
had on her back, and a few of her maids. The
cardinal was taken to S. Angelo and every one
has given him up for dead.”</p>

<p>In his dispatch of January 5, 1503, the
ambassador says that Pope Alexander held a
convocation the evening before and explained to
the cardinals why he had imprisoned Cardinal
Orsini, and he also informed them that everything
he had heard regarding the prelate’s treachery
toward himself and Caesar had been confirmed
since his imprisonment; that all this and more,
too, was true. The cardinals begged for mercy
for their colleague, to which his Holiness replied
that he would be governed by a sense of justice
in whatever he did with respect to Orsini; that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
he would see that he was not wronged, and was
treated with perfect justice; then he assured them
of his love and of his appreciation of their recommendation—and
his words confirmed all in their
belief that he intended to have Orsini put to death.</p>

<p>The same day the Pope’s son Giuffre and Jacopo
Santa Croce, probably as the cardinal’s representative
for form’s sake, with an adequate force rode
to Mount Rotundo, and in the name of his Holiness
took possession of it and of all the other property
of the Orsini, including the abbey of Farfa.</p>

<p>The day after the murder of Vitelli and Oliverotto
Caesar set out for Perugia and Siena, having with
him his prisoners Paolo and Francesco Orsini.
Before he left Sinigaglia Andrea Doria had surrendered
the citadel to him on receiving Caesar’s
permission to retire whithersoever he wished.</p>

<p>On the way Valentino took possession of Vitelli’s
capital, Città di Castello, which had been abandoned
by the inhabitants. Then he set out for
Perugia, where the Duke of Urbino and the Prince
of Camerino, Vitelli’s nephew, had found refuge
under the protection of Giampaolo Baglioni, who
had announced his intention of resisting. Caesar
had, however, no sooner reached Gualdo—January
5th—than the Duke of Urbino fled to
Pitigliano, and Baglioni, abandoning his wife and
children, who fell into the hands of Caesar’s men,
made his escape, and joined Pandolfo Petrucci in
Siena.</p>

<p>Their leaders having deserted them, the people
of Fermo and Perugia sent messengers to Valentino
offering him their allegiance, which he accepted,
and, having appointed Vincenzo Calmeto and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
Agapito Gerardino Governors of these places, he
set out for Siena. When he reached Assisi—January
7th—he was met by envoys from Siena,
come to ask him what terms he would grant. His
first demand was that they surrender Pandolfo
Petrucci, and without waiting for an answer he
pressed forward in the direction of Castel della
Pieve. While there he made public the treaty into
which he had entered with Giovanni Bentivoglio,
who, to prove his sincerity, immediately announced
that he was ready to dispatch the troops he had
agreed to furnish. At the same time the marriage
contract of the sister of the Bishop of Elne, a
relative of the Pope and Caesar, with Costanzo
Bentivoglio was signed—this had also been stipulated
in the treaty.</p>

<p>Caesar reached Castel della Pieve January 18th,
and there he had Paolo and Francesco Orsini
strangled. He had stated that he intended to
imprison them in Civita Castellana, but he probably
found their presence hampering to his movements
and concluded that there was no reason to defer
their death, upon which he was resolved. The
papal Master of Ceremonies calmly records the
fact: “January 18th Francesco Orsini, Duke of
Gravina, Paolo Orsini, and the Chevalier Orsini<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a>
were killed and strangled by Michelotto and Marco
Romano by order of the Duke Valentino.”</p>

<p>When the Pope was asked about the affair he
replied coldly, saying that he knew nothing about
it, as he had received no letters from the Duke;
and to give an appearance of truth to what he
said he added that the Duke had entered upon the
Sienese expedition without his consent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
Cardinal Orsini had been in prison since
January 2nd. For a time his mother, who
was then eighty years old, was allowed to bring
him his meals, but this was finally forbidden. In
vain she and her son offered large sums for his
liberty; she even sent the Pope a very valuable
pearl which he had admired; he accepted it and
again allowed her to furnish the cardinal his meals;
“but it was believed he had already drunk the
cup the Pope had prepared for him.” The Holy
Father continued to tell Orsini to be of good cheer
and to look to his health, and he informed the
cardinals in consistory that he had directed his
physicians to take the best of care of the prisoner.
His age, the humiliation he had suffered, and the
confinement were, however, more than he could
withstand. About the middle of February it was
rumoured that the cardinal was ill of the fever,
and the 22nd of the month he passed away.
Immediately the report spread that he had died
of poison, and to disprove the rumour the Pope
ordered the corpse to be carried to the church
on an open litter and with the face uncovered,
and he further commanded all the Orsini in Rome
to attend the funeral. Giustinian clearly believed
that the cardinal had been poisoned. In this connection
it is worth remarking that while the
Venetian ambassador is hostile to the Borgia he
would not intentionally distort what he believed
to be facts in his dispatches to his own Government;
he was in Rome to watch Alexander and
to keep the Senate fully informed of every event.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
Had he misled his Government his services would
have been worthless and he would have been
promptly recalled.</p>

<p>Burchard’s comment is as follows: “To-day,
February 22nd, Cardinal Orsini died in Castle
S. Angelo—and may his soul rest in peace. Amen!
His Holiness directed my colleague D. Bernardino
Guttieri to take charge of the funeral of the
deceased—therefore I did not wish to know anything
more than was necessary, I was not present—and
I took no part in it.”</p>

<p>Soderini, the Florentine orator, in a letter of
February 23rd, says: “Cardinal Orsini was buried
yesterday at the twenty-fourth hour in S. Salvatore,
the church of the Orsini; by the Pope’s order the
corpse was accompanied by his family and by those
of the cardinals of the palace. It lay uncovered
on a cloth of gold, clad in a chasuble of red
damascas silk embroidered with gold flowers. On
the head was a white miter.”</p>

<p>In the meantime, in defiance of the Pope and
Caesar, the inhabitants of Siena remained faithful
to Pandolfo Petrucci, and January 27, 1503, Valentino
sent word from his camp in Pienza that he
would give them twenty-four hours to expel their
chieftain. The same day the Pope dispatched a
brief to the officials of the <em>Balia</em> of Siena containing
a similar demand. Both documents are
given by Alvisi. Caesar lays aside all diplomacy
and writes in a tone of mastery and <span class="locked">confidence:—</span></p>

<p>“To-day, the 27th of the month, at the twenty-third
hour we received a letter from Cipriano, our
chancellor, written yesterday in Siena, from which
we learn that you have failed to execute the stipulations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
contained in the treaty into which we
entered. If by the day named you have not
expelled Pandolfo from your city and domain we
shall proceed against you; we will make you
understand that we are not to be deceived by you.
We have justly conceived such contempt for your
conduct that we are unable to find words to express
it in a letter; and we swear by God that when
you have received this letter, if you have not
already driven forth, without any more delay, the
said Pandolfo we will regard each one of you as
the same as Pandolfo, and forthwith proceed to
the total destruction of all your subjects, goods,
and domain, and of your city and of yourselves.”</p>

<p>Then he scolds them for their ingratitude, and
reminds them that with his own troops and without
their aid and with no expense whatsoever to the
Republic he stands ready to relieve their country
of a scheming tyrant. He signs the letter <i xml:lang="it" lang="it">Caesar
Borgia de Francia Dux Romandiolae Valentiaeque
Princeps</i>.</p>

<p>The Sienese refused to comply, and Caesar proceeded
to execute his threat by sending out troops
to ravage the country. The towns of Pienza, Chiusi,
Castel della Pieve, and San Quirico were destroyed
and the inhabitants put to the sword; the people
of Viterbo, Acquapendente, and Montefiascono suffered
the same fate; old men and women were
tortured and killed; the fruit-trees were cut down
and everything that might offer shelter for the
fugitives was destroyed. Burchard records that
at San Quirico Caesar’s soldiers suspended two old
men and nine old women by the arms and lighted
fires under their feet to torture them into revealing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
where they had hidden their valuables; they, however,
would not disclose the place, and died in
torment.</p>

<p>The people of Siena, terrified by the cruelties
of Caesar’s troops, sent a delegation to the <em>Balia</em>
to say that it was wrong for all to be destroyed
for the sake of one. Petrucci thereupon decided
to leave, and he authorised the Council to treat
in his name, but he reserved the right to remove
with all his troops. Caesar and the Pope, knowing
the city was well supplied with men and munitions
of war and admirably situated for withstanding
a siege, decided it was wise not to impose too
harsh conditions. The Sienese were brave and
determined, and they had the support of Giampaolo
Baglioni, an able captain. Furthermore, Siena,
which enjoyed the favour of the King of France,
had never been part of the papal domain. The
undertaking against Siena was therefore abandoned
for the time being.</p>

<p>Caesar and the Pope may have thought that the
Orsini in and about Rome were becoming too
dangerous; they and their followers were swearing
vengeance for the murder of their kinsmen Paolo
and Francesco, and the imprisonment of the
cardinal, Giambattista Orsini.</p>

<p>Giulio Orsini had collected a considerable force
at Pitigliano, and Fabio and Organtini held
Cervetri, while Giovanni and a number of the
family’s supporters had fortified themselves at Ceri.
In addition Silvio Savelli had joined the Orsini
forces in the Campagna, and all were determined
to fight to the death.</p>

<p>Caesar hastened to Rome and the Pope urged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
him to proceed against the Orsini immediately; but
the son, no less resolute than the father, was even
more astute and thought it best to delay, for which
he readily found a pretext. Niccolò Orsini, Count
of Pitigliano, was a condottiere in the pay of Venice,
and this was one of the reasons why Valentino
decided to temporise. When Alexander wanted
him to seize Bracciano, Caesar objected on the
ground that its lord, Giangiordano Orsini, was in
the service of the King of France in Naples and,
like himself, was a member of the Order of St.
Michael, therefore he could not make war upon
him, and of this Louis XII. took occasion to remind
him by a special messenger. Valentino was too
shrewd to incur the King’s displeasure at this
juncture, and he concluded it would be wiser to
secure and establish order in the States he had
already won than it would be to endeavour to add
to his domain.</p>

<p>The King of France undoubtedly had misgivings
regarding Caesar’s growing power. Pisa, the
relentless enemy of Florence, the King’s protégé,
had requested Valentino’s aid, and if Perugia and
Siena fell into his hands a formidable power would
be established in central Italy under an energetic,
brave, and daring soldier—one who would hesitate
at nothing and who already enjoyed great prestige.</p>

<p>Louis XII. therefore immediately set about
forming a coalition, comprising Siena, Lucca,
Florence, and Bologna, to curb Caesar’s ambition.</p>

<p>Alexander was annoyed by what he considered
the King’s unwarranted interference, and accused
Caesar of weakness with respect to the Orsini. The
Duke, however, persisted in his determination to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
leave Bracciano and Pitigliano alone and to lay
siege to Ceri.</p>

<p>The ancient town of Ceri was famous for its
stronghold. The castle had been regarded as impregnable;
it had resisted numerous sieges from
Roman days down through the Middle Ages. It
was defended by a large number of troops with
able leaders, consequently Caesar’s task was a
difficult one.</p>

<p>The Duke went to Rome about the middle of
February, but never left the palace except disguised.
The Pope was so displeased by his refusal
to proceed against Bracciano that he threatened
to excommunicate him and deprive him of his
estates. Although Caesar probably did not regard
these threats as very serious, he prepared to go to
Cervetri, where he had left his captains—Ludovico
della Mirandola, Ugo Moncada, and Michelotto de
Corella. He left Rome April 6th for Cervetri,
but on the way learned that the town had capitulated
to the Count of Mirandola. The defenders
threw themselves on Caesar’s mercy, and he conducted
Giulio Orsini to the Pope and interceded for
him so effectively that he was restored to liberty.</p>

<p>Giangiordano Orsini betook himself to Celle,
in the Abruzzi, and while he was there the Pope
offered to give him the principality of Squillace
if he would relinquish all claims to his estates in
the Romagna. These terms were accepted and,
with the aid of the French ambassador, were
embodied in a treaty which was drawn up April 8th.</p>

<p>Caesar had now become a power in Italy;
soldiers of fortune flocked to his standard; he
was the most dreaded man in the entire peninsula;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
the wealth of the Church was at his command
and the influence of the Papacy was behind him.
All the castles in the Patrimonium Petri were held
by his lieutenants. Matarazzo says he was now
the first captain in Italy, not owing to great knowledge
of the art of war but to his treachery and
corrupt use of money—he had reduced the science
of warfare merely to a consummate art of deception.</p>

<p>He, however, had great and loyal admirers
because the Italian of the sixteenth century had
not learned that the success of men in an evil
environment is commensurate with their own
capacity for iniquity; that in human competition
the ethical sense, the finer feelings, often preclude
great achievement. All that Caesar had won he
had secured by treachery and crime.</p>

<p>The politicians of the day attributed his success
chiefly to the favour of the Pope and of the King
of France, while the astrologers held the stars
responsible, pronouncing him <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">filium fortunae</i>.
Official astrologers, however, like the sycophants
of the present, were not blind to their own interests.
Cardinal Francesco Soderini says that among the
attributes of greatness in Caesar and the Pope was
their ability to recognise their opportunities and
to avail themselves of them to the utmost—but
this they could not have done had they possessed
even a suggestion of the altruistic sense; theirs
was simply the success of utter, merciless egoism.</p>

<p>The dispatches of the day are filled with
suspicions and rumours regarding the aims of the
Pope and Caesar; some said the former was plotting
with the Spaniards to secure the Kingdom of
Sicily for his son; others thought he had his eye<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
on Tuscany. Machiavelli wrote: “Caesar having
always thought little of Venice and still less of
Florence, it would be well for the latter to build up
such a powerful State in Italy that her friendship
would be desired by some other potentate.” The
secretary also says that Caesar doubtless aspired to
the dominion of Tuscany, which, owing to her situation,
would serve well with the other States he possessed
to form a kingdom. Alvisi thinks that these
suspicions and rumours were due to the universal
fear of Caesar and he also suggests that the talk
of a crown for Valentino may have been due to the
steps Alexander VI. had taken to erect the Duchy
of Romagna into the Kingdom of Adria, which had
already been attempted by Clement VII. in 1379,
for a prince of the house of Anjou. This action,
however, would not have enlarged the domain he
already possessed, and it is even possible that the
Pope actually did intend to restore the entire Campagna
to the Church after crushing the barons who
were withholding it.</p>

<p>While Caesar’s captains were occupied about Ceri
the Pope, with his own guard and a few of Valentino’s
men took possession of Palombara, Lenzano,
Cervetri, and other towns belonging to the Savelli.</p>

<p>The Spaniards in the Regno were successfully
resisting the French, and Louis’s influence was
rapidly waning. He was, however, still actively
supporting the league which he had formed against
Valentino.</p>

<p>After Pandolfo Petrucci’s departure from Siena
the people became uneasy; the King therefore
caused him to return.</p>

<p>Valentino’s grasp on the duchy was far from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
secure; many of the strongholds of the Montefeltre
were still holding out against him; Lattanzio da
Bergamo, shut up in San Leo, felt he could defend
himself until the Duke of Urbino returned to relieve
him. At the same time, the continued activity of
the Orsini and their numerous adherents made it
necessary for Caesar to remain in, or near, Rome
and postpone for a time at least his projected conquests.
In fine, conditions were such that he would
be fortunate if he succeeded in conserving what he
had already secured.</p>

<p>The extraordinary record of events in the Vatican,
Burchard’s <cite>Diarium</cite>, breaks off abruptly in February,
1503, not to be resumed again until the
following August, but Caesar’s presence in and
about Rome is attested by numerous documents
and letters.</p>

<p>Louis XII. having established a league comprising
Florence, Siena, Lucca, and Bologna, Pandolfo
Petrucci, escorted by a French troop, returned to
Siena, March 29, 1503. Discord, however, arose
among the allies and gave Caesar renewed hope.
The dominion of the Pope and his son Caesar did
not extend beyond the Patrimonium Petri and even
there it was limited by Ferrara and Bologna.
Valentino, profiting by conditions in the Regno,
began to plot with Spain, who saw in him an able
ally against France.</p>

<p>In April, 1503, Gonsalvo de Cordova had begun
a brilliant campaign in Apulia; the French commanders
Aubigny and Nemours were repeatedly
defeated and finally Gonsalvo entered Naples,
May 14th, the remnant of the French forces
retreating to Gaeta.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
Louis XII. sent all the troops he had at Genoa,
under the command of the Marquis of Saluzzo, to
aid the beleaguered army in Gaeta and in the meantime
Gonsalvo had decided to attempt the capture
of the place and also of Castel Nuovo, the last
strongholds of the French. The latter place surrendered,
but the former held out until the arrival
of the Marquis of Saluzzo, who forced the
Spaniards to retreat to Naples. In the meantime
Prospero Colonna, who was in the service of Spain,
had been uniformly successful in Calabria and the
Abruzzi.</p>

<p>Caesar and the Pope anxiously followed the
course of events in the south; the defeat of
France would permit them to renew their efforts
against Siena and Perugia, and also against Giangiordano
Orsini. Valentino could accept the lordship
of Siena, which the inhabitants had offered him
but which Louis, out of regard for Florence, had
compelled him to refuse, and once in possession of
Pisa he could attack Florence.</p>

<p>Caesar had been forced to defer his own projects
in Romagna because of the sending of forces from
Genoa by Louis to aid the besieged at Gaeta. By
his agreement he was required to assist the King
of France, and he had already dispatched some of
his captains—among them Fracasso and the Count
of Mirandola—to the French camp, and by the
middle of July he had gathered a considerable force
about Perugia.</p>

<p>The rumours that the Pope and Caesar were plotting
with Spain continued, and the tyrants whom
they had been endeavouring to crush asked permission
of the King of France to proceed against
the Duke. Above all, Guidobaldo di Montefeltre<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
hoped his relative, the Marquis of Mantua, would
help him to return to Urbino.</p>

<p>In the meantime—July 28th—in public consistory,
the Pope announced Caesar’s departure for
the field. August 7th the Venetian ambassador
wrote that the Pope had told him Caesar would
set forth the following day; at the same time his
Holiness stated, placing his hand on his heart and
swearing on the word of Christ’s Vicar, that it
was not his intention to engage in any undertaking
against any one, but simply to attend to his own
affairs, and especially the state of Urbino, where,
he said, “those in San Leo are constantly trying
something new.” Then, turning to Cardinal Adriano,
he said: “Bring these Florentine shopkeepers here
to-morrow—I wish to assure them that the Duke’s
expedition is not against them, or any one else,
unless some one should justly provoke him”—and
he displayed considerable impatience.</p>

<p>The heat in Italy that year—1503—was intense,
and the plague broke out in Rome and elsewhere.
The 1st of August Cardinal Borgia of Monreale
was stricken, and the 9th Alexander prepared a
bull appointing the Cardinal of Este perpetual
administrator of the diocese; the bull, however,
was never issued, for the Pope himself and Valentino
fell ill of the plague August 12th.</p>

<p>The next day the Holy Father was bled and he
seemed somewhat better, for he called a number of
the cardinals to his bedside and interested himself
in watching them play cards. The 14th the fever
returned and again the 16th. The doors of the
palace were closed and the physician and attendants
were not allowed to leave his Holiness. Then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
they bethought them of a saintly woman who lived
immured in a cell in the Vatican and asked her
to pray for the Holy Father, but she said that there
was no hope. August 18th the Pope confessed to
the Bishop of Carniola and then, seated on the bed,
received the Sacrament. The same evening the
Bishop administered the extreme unction and, in
the presence of the datary and a few officials of
the palace, the monster who for eleven years had
occupied the throne of St. Peter expired.</p>

<p>On the death of Alexander all sorts of rumours
were circulated, including, of course, one to the
effect that he had been poisoned. It is, however,
practically certain that he simply died of a tertian
fever. Burchard’s notes are extremely clear and
concise.</p>

<p>In his dispatch of August 11th Giustinian says
“the Pope did not enter the chapel at the celebration
of the anniversary of his elevation to the
Papacy with his usual cheerful demeanour”—which
the Ambassador attributes, probably incorrectly, to
worry caused by the political situation. The 13th
he gives particulars of the illness of the Pope and
of Valentino, and refers to a dinner given by
Cardinal Adriano di Corneto about a week before,
and states that all the guests had fallen ill, which
of course strengthened the suspicion of poison; the
host himself was the first to be stricken. Giustinian
endeavours to follow the course of the fever in
the Pope and Caesar, but great secrecy was maintained
by those who were admitted to the palace.
The Venetian ambassador clearly discerned what the
death of either or of both of them meant for Italy
and he tried to keep his Government fully informed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
August 18th at the nineteenth hour the ambassador
again wrote his Government saying that a
messenger had just come from the Bishop of
Carniola, who was constantly with his Holiness,
asking him to send his secretary to the Vatican,
which he did; whereupon the Bishop informed him
that the Pope was in the throes of dissolution and
could not live through the night. He adds that while
his courier was waiting for the dispatch a messenger
came to inform him that a member of the Pope’s
household had gone to the warder of the Castle
of St. Angelo and directed him to place all his
men under arms, load the artillery, and put the
stronghold in a state of defence.</p>

<p>At the twenty-third hour the orator again wrote
the Senate saying that the Pope’s physician, Scipio,
had informed him that his Holiness could not
survive the night. The physician—<i xml:lang="it" lang="it">omo excellente
nell’ arte soa</i>—stated that the Pope’s illness, in
his opinion, began with a stroke of apoplexy. He
also said that the Duke was in no danger, that he
had no fever and could leave his bed any time he
desired so to do. For his own safety Valentino was
preparing to remove that night to the Castle of St.
Angelo, whither the two children, Giovanni, the
Pope’s youngest son, and Rodrigo, Lucretia’s boy,
had already been sent. Early that morning
Caesar’s troops had been ordered to Rome with
all speed and they had been pouring into the city
all day. They had been massed in the Borgo and
drummers had been sent about the city to call the
guard to arms; the palace was entirely surrounded
by troops, foot and horse.</p>

<p>At the first hour of the night Don Alvarotto di<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
Alvarotis, a member of the household of the
Cardinal of Santa Prassede, informed Giustinian
that while he was with the cardinal the Duke’s
chamberlain, Don Romolino, had come and told
them that his Holiness had just passed away. The
ambassador was also informed of the death of the
Cardinal of Trani. The same morning, according
to the messenger, Caesar had dispatched a courier
to Prospero Colonna to ask his support and to
offer to restore his estates to him.</p>

<p>Gregorovius inclines to the theory of poison, but
Burchard records no such suspicion. The corpse
was “monstrously swollen and discoloured—black,
a most horrible thing to behold, and many suspected
poison,” wrote Beltrando Costabili to his master,
Ercole of Ferrara. “Never since the beginning
of Christianity has there been seen such a terrible
and horrible thing. It was the most bestial, monstrous,
and horrible body, without the form or face
of a man.” Wonderful were the stories told; while
he lay ill Alexander had even seen the devil in
the form of a monkey enter his room to bear his
soul away.</p>

<p>The grounds for believing that the Pope had
been poisoned are so slight that they may be disregarded.
It is clear from the statements of
Burchard and Giustinian, who was hostile to the
Borgia, that Alexander VI. died of a tertian fever,
or the plague, which in that year destroyed a vast
number of people in Italy. The Pope was a fleshy
man, well advanced in years, and the appearance
of the corpse, even if it were as hideous as it
was described, would not necessarily indicate that
he had died of poison.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
Beltrando Costabili, the Ferrarese orator, concluded
a letter dated August 14th with the remark:
“It is not strange that the Pope and Caesar are
sick, because almost all the prominent men in Rome
are ill—and especially in the Vatican, owing to the
bad air.” Stories of the poisoning began to circulate
as soon as the rapidity with which the body
putrefied became known.</p>

<p>Guicciardini’s account has been followed by all
later writers until the present day, and he was
one of the bitterest of the enemies of the Borgia.
According to his statement, before Caesar’s departure
for the field he and the Pope were invited to
dine with Cardinal Adriano di Corneto. Romolino,
Valentino’s intimate, and two other cardinals were
also present. One of the Borgia, desiring to secure
possession of their host’s property, decided to
poison him, but the servants confused the glasses
and gave Alexander and Caesar the envenomed
cups. This account was based on a letter written
by Peter Martyr of Anghiara, from Segovia,
November 10, 1503—that is, about three months
after the death of the Pope. None of the ambassadors
in Rome, who were closely following events
in the Vatican, even hinted at poison at the time.</p>

<p>The facts, briefly summarised, were as follows:
The dinner took place August 5th; Caesar and
the Pope fell ill the 10th; the latter was feverish
the 12th; the 16th he was bled copiously and
his illness became serious; the 17th he was given
an exceedingly powerful draught of some sort which
failed to relieve him; the 18th, feeling that his
end was approaching, he confessed to the Bishop
of Carniola, who administered the Communion.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
Later, Mass was celebrated at his bedside in the
presence of five cardinals. The Pope was extremely
weak and he declared that he felt death was near.
The Bishop of Carniola administered the Extreme
Unction and a few hours later the Holy Father
expired—thirteen days after the dinner in Cardinal
Corneto’s garden, which precludes the idea of
poison.</p>

<p>Giustinian makes no mention of poison. Beltrando
Costabili, the Ferrarese ambassador, who
followed the course of the Pope’s illness from
hour to hour, likewise does not suggest it.
Alexander VI. was probably merely one of the many
victims reaped by the plague in Rome in 1503.</p>

<p>The rumour of poisoning spread through the city
and found many believers who, hating the Borgias
and believing they had dispatched many by
means of poison, were only too glad to conclude
that they had fallen victims to a plot which
they had laid for another. Caesar’s illness at the
same time further strengthened the conviction, as
did also the horrible condition of the Pope’s body.
Not until after the funeral does Costabili refer to
the suspicion of poison.</p>

<p>Valentino, being young and vigorous, recovered
in spite of the heroic treatment to which he, according
to reports of the day, was subjected. It was
said that his physician, Gaspare Torrella, had him
wrapped in the warm entrails of a disembowelled
mule; another story was that he had been placed
in an enormous amphora filled with ice.</p>

<p>Whatever the means employed to save his life
his appearance had greatly changed. Formerly
accounted one of the handsomest men in Italy—not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
excepting King Ferdinand of Naples—he was
described now as altogether revolting, and the
marks of the severe treatment he had undergone
persisted until his dying day.</p>

<p>The ambassadors—whose function it is to flatter
publicly—had frequently spoken of Caesar as
“blonde and handsome”—“like the Emperor
Tiberius, the handsomest man of his day”; but
Paul Jovius says “his face was disfigured with
red blotches and pimples; his eyes, which were
very deep set, had a cruel and venomous look and
seemed to dart flames.”</p>

<p>When the Pope passed away the Duke, who was
still ill, sent Michelotto with a number of men
to lock all the doors of the palace, and when the
Cardinal of Casanova hesitated to give up the keys
one of the swashbucklers drew his sword and
threatened to cot his throat and throw him from
the window, whereupon the cardinal in terror surrendered
the keys. Then they took possession of
all the money they could lay their hands on—about
100,000 ducats. Later the servants of the palace
rushed in and appropriated everything that was left.
The Duke did not go near the Pope during his
illness, and his Holiness never once mentioned him
or Lucretia. The minute Master of Ceremonies
describes the obsequies at great length; he also
gives an inventory of the dead Pope’s effects—that
is, such as had escaped Caesar’s henchmen and
the servants.</p>

<p>The very day of the funeral Silvio Savelli
returned and took possession of his house and of
the prison of the Sabelle, from which all the
prisoners were immediately released.</p>

<p class="in0"><span class="pfirst">Rome</span> was in a tumult; the enemies of the House
of Borgia and of the Spanish party began to pour
into the city. The Orsini were the first to appear;
Fabio, Niccolò, and Giangiordano, with their
followers, at once prepared to take possession
of their estates in the Romagna. Prospero Colonna
led his army up to the very gates of the city.
The Vitelli were advancing on Città di Castella,
Giampaolo Baglioni attacked Perugia; Urbino,
Camerino, Cagli, and Piombino were ready to
revolt; Caesar’s domain was to crumble away in
a day. Valentino did not lose courage; he was
resolute, defiant; he had—so he told Machiavelli
later—prepared for everything, even for the death
of the Pope—for all but one contingency, and that
was his own illness.</p>

<p>The streets were thronged with troops; the
Spanish cardinals, officials, retainers, hangers-on,
spies, informers, bullies were panic-stricken; they
barricaded their doors and armed themselves. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
was feared the French would seize the opportunity
and advance on the city, and to the south not far
away was the army of the King of Spain. The
Sacred College, whose duty it was to elect a
successor to Alexander, had no military force at
their command, and they were afraid to appeal
to Caesar, who, with his well-disciplined troops and
able commanders, was still the strongest power in
the city.</p>

<p>The Orsini and the Colonna, now at the very
gates of Rome, were ready to fly at Valentino’s
throat. The cardinals Santa Croce, Cesarini, and
De’ Medici went to the warder of the Castle of St.
Angelo, Francesco de Roccamura, a Spaniard, to
assure themselves of his support, and, although
he was one of Alexander’s creatures, to his great
credit and in spite of Caesar’s efforts to win him
over, he remained faithful to the Sacred College
as the representative of the papal power. He
trained his cannon on the streets leading to the
castle and his men shouted “Collegio, Collegio!
Chiesa, Chiesa!” The same afternoon the Spanish
mob burned the Orsini palaces on Monte Giordano.</p>

<p>August 21st the cardinals, to the number of
seventeen, again met in the Minerva, and the question
of entering into some agreement with Valentino
was discussed at length. The Duke had professed
loyalty and devotion to the Sacred College, and
Pandolfo, a notary, was directed to confer with
Caesar’s secretary, Agapito of Amelia.</p>

<p>August 22nd, through his secretary, Caesar
swore obedience to the cardinals, who confirmed
him in his office of Captain-General of the Church.
The cardinals had warned both the Colonna and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
the Orsini to keep away from Rome, but, disregarding
their orders, Prospero Colonna entered the city
with a small force of cavalry. The next day
Ludovico and Fabio Orsini also appeared with their
followers. Determined to avenge the murder of
their kinsmen and the plundering of their estates,
they sought Caesar, and failing to find him,
they wrecked their vengeance on the Castilians
generally. Valentino and the Spanish cardinals
kept to the Vatican, and without the whole city
was in a tumult. Gangs of ruffians rushed about
shouting “Colonna! Orsini! Borgia!”</p>

<p>Caesar’s political sagacity coming to his aid, he
endeavoured to separate the Colonna, whom he had
injured the least, from the Orsini. These great
rival families had been brought together by the
wrongs they had suffered at the hands of the
Borgia. Caesar offered to restore the property of
the Colonna, and this offer Prospero promptly
accepted, at the same time promising in return
to support the Duke. This agreement saved
Caesar for a time, and it was thought that in the
impending conclave a Pope favourable to the
Borgia might be elected. The Orsini were
frightened and, yielding to the demands of the
cardinals, withdrew from the city during the night
of August 24th.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
In the meantime the Italian cardinals had been
insisting that Caesar also leave Rome. The Sacred
College had secured about two thousand troops and
had placed the city under the protection of the
ambassadors of the Emperor, of Spain, France,
and Venice, who—August 25th—went to Valentino,
whom they found in the Vatican stretched upon a
bed, but completely dressed and surrounded by the
Spanish cardinals, and requested him to leave the
palace. This he refused to do, saying that he was
ill and that he would be safe nowhere else. Thereupon
they offered him the Castle of St. Angelo
for his abode. Caesar asked permission for his
troops also to occupy the stronghold. He was
still Duke of Romagna and he had more than nine
thousand men under his command. He also had
large amounts of money on deposit with Alessandro
Spanocchi, consequently he was treated as a
reigning prince. Both the Spanish and French
ambassadors knew that his aid would be valuable
in the war in Naples, and Prospero Colonna was
endeavouring to persuade him to enter the service
of Gonsalvo de Cordova. At the same time France
was trying to secure him.</p>

<p>Finally, to the utter dismay of Colonna and the
Spanish cardinals, he decided to cast his fortunes
with the latter power, for September 1st, through
the mediation of Grammont, the French ambassador,
he entered into an agreement by which he
was to place his troops at the service of France
in the Regno and to hold himself in readiness at
all times to aid the King, and to use all his influence
with the Spanish cardinals to secure the
election of the Cardinal of Rouen to the Papacy.</p>

<p>No sooner had Georges d’Amboise, Cardinal of
Rouen, learned of the death of Alexander VI. than
he set out in great haste for Rome, feeling
certain that he could be elected to succeed the
Borgia. The Papacy was the dream of his life,
and he was ardently supported by the King, who
would profit greatly by the election of his minister.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
In fact, Louis thought that if Amboise, his intimate
friend, his subject, his Prime Minister, became Pope
he could easily make himself master of all Italy.
Amboise, with the French army under the very
walls of Rome, promptly secured a strong
following in the Sacred College.</p>

<p>By his agreement with France Caesar was
assured the protection of the King both as to his
person and his property. The same day—September
1st—Valentino entered into an arrangement with
the Sacred College, one clause of which required
him to leave Rome within three days. Prospero
Colonna had also been compelled to depart, and
the ambassadors of Maximilian and of Louis XII.
guaranteed that while the papal throne was vacant
Caesar, the Colonna, and the Spanish forces would
not approach within ten miles of Rome; the orators
of Venice and France did the same with respect to
the French army and the Orsini.</p>

<p>Giustinian says it was agreed that Prospero
Colonna should leave September 2nd, and Caesar,
with all his artillery, the following day. Colonna
did depart on the appointed day and Caesar withdrew
a little later with all his troops, horse, foot,
and artillery. The Duke himself was so ill that
he had to be borne on a litter. The Venetian
orator adds: “Now that Caesar has gone it is
thought that the election will take place quietly and
without any disturbance, since every one respects
the Sacred College.” Still, some uneasiness was
felt lest the French should cause a disturbance,
because Odoardo Bugliotto, the King’s valet, had
arrived with a large amount of money, determined
to make the Cardinal of Rouen Pope. Monsignor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
de Trans had told Giustinian that neither Ascanio
Sforza nor any of the other cardinals then in France
would attend the conclave, “nevertheless, yesterday
evening the report was circulated, and this
morning it was confirmed, that Amboise, Sforza,
San Malo, and Aragona<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> were already on the way,
and,” he adds, “if this is true there will be much
intriguing, for these men are seditious and shameless
and with their astuteness and machinations
cause much disturbance, and may God in his mercy
watch over Christendom.”</p>

<p>The same day—September 2nd—Giustinian informs
his Government: “It is learned that
Valentino, without the knowledge of any one,
has entered into an agreement with France.”</p>

<p>Prospero Colonna was greatly chagrined by
Caesar’s last trick, and when he left Rome he took
with him the Princess of Squillace—“who will be
some comfort to him—while the Prince went with
the Duke. The Princess departed willingly, hoping
to recover her estates in the Regno—in any event
there is little love between her and her husband
as they are entirely unlike.” Owing to the trouble
and discord she had occasioned in the family,
the Princess Sancia had been imprisoned by
Alexander VI. in the Castle of St. Angelo.</p>

<p>Burchard describes Valentino’s departure in
detail. The very morning of the agreement he
paid his troops and sent thirteen heavy wagons
laden with engines of war forward through
Trastevere. He had three large bombards, two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
medium, and eight small ones. Then he dispatched
his guard to the Milvius Bridge, there to await
him. More than a hundred wagons were required
for his baggage. They left the Vatican by the
Viridaria Gate and proceeded to Monte Mario, the
Duke borne on a litter by twelve halberdiers. After
him was led a magnificent charger with trappings
of black velvet, embroidered with his arms and the
ducal crown.</p>

<p>The Spanish and French ambassadors accompanied
him as far as the city gate. Caesar set
out for Nepi, a town belonging to his family, the
citadel of which was still loyal to him. Gregorovius
says his mother Vannozza and his brother
Giuffre accompanied him.</p>

<p>Valentino was still a power to be reckoned with,
and he undoubtedly hoped to secure the election
of a Pope who would be friendly to himself and
the Borgia family, for he knew that he could count
on the votes of the eleven Spanish cardinals.</p>

<p>Alexander’s obsequies began September 4th, and
in accordance with the papal custom continued for
nine days. The cardinals, however, soon lost
interest in the ceremonies and were anxious to enter
into conclave. One after another the cardinals
who, for various reasons, had been living abroad
returned. All Rome was looking forward to the
event which to Caesar was the most momentous
in his entire career—not excepting the election
of his own father to the Papacy—for not only
his future but his very life depended on the
outcome.</p>

<p>The French army, under Monsignor de La Trémoille
and the Marquis of Mantua, had entered the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
Romagna, where they were ordered to remain until
a successor to Alexander had been elected.</p>

<p>Giuliano della Rovere, after an absence of ten
years in France, returned to Italy September 3rd;
Cardinal Colonna, who had been hiding in Sicily
for five years, appeared a few days later; the 9th
the Romans received Riario in triumph, and the
next day Ascanio Sforza, Georges d’Amboise, and
the Cardinal d’Aragona made their entry. Amboise
had secured Sforza’s release from prison and had
brought him with him from France, counting upon
securing his vote. The Cardinal of Rouen also
felt certain that at the proper moment Caesar
would throw the votes of the Spanish cardinals for
him, and he believed that the near presence of the
French troops would influence the Sacred College
in his favour, because they would immediately see
that the Papacy would be greatly strengthened by
having the support of the armies of France. He,
however, was not slow to discover that Ascanio
Sforza was the favourite of the Romans; moreover,
the Sacred College promptly requested Amboise not
to permit any of the French troops to enter the city.</p>

<p>When Giustinian called upon Giuliano della
Rovere on his arrival in Rome the cardinal remarked
to him: “I am here in my own interests
and not in those of any one else; I am not here
to cast my vote for the Cardinal of Rouen unless
I should see that even without my vote he could
be elected—which I think is impossible.” He
added that he was a good Italian and that he could
not be forced to make a Pope unless it were for
the good of the Christian religion and the peace
and welfare of Italy; he also expressed great affection<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
for Venice and promised to consider her
interests.</p>

<p>September 16, 1503, thirty-eight cardinals
entered the conclave which was held in the Vatican.
They first drew up an agreement which was to be
submitted to any power that would guarantee their
rights; they also promised to reform the abuses
which were wellnigh universal in ecclesiastical
affairs, and agreed to summon a council for that
purpose within two years; they also promised to
prosecute the war against the Turks. The urgency
of the situation in which they were placed cut short
the discussion. The Italians and the Spaniards
united against Amboise and agreed to elect a Pope
who could not long survive, and, September 22nd,
on the second scrutiny they selected Francesco
Piccolomini, Cardinal of Siena, to be the supreme
head of the Church. He adopted the name
Pius III.</p>

<p>Piccolomini had been Cardinal-Deacon forty-three
years; he was a man of probity, advanced in years,
and a sufferer from the gout, with not long to live.
Giuliano della Rovere, seeing that his own election
was impossible, had secured the elevation of Piccolomini.
French politics had failed signally, and
Pius III. promptly compelled the Marquis of
Mantua to withdraw his troops from the Romagna.</p>

<p>The college had been divided into three nearly
equal factions—the French, the Spanish, and the
Italian, whose respective candidates were Georges
d’Amboise, Bernardino Carvajal, and Giuliano
della Rovere. Caesar for obvious reasons had
supported the French candidate, and had succeeded
in frustrating Della Rovere’s plans; the latter,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
however, had immediately discerned the true situation,
and with the aid of Oliviero Caraffa, Cardinal
of Naples, and Girolamo Basso della Rovere, Cardinal
of Recanati, succeeded in placing his Eminence
of Siena in the papal chair, thereby giving
himself time to perfect his own plans for securing
the great prize on the demise of Pius III., which
was sure to take place soon.</p>

<p>Pius III. was born in Siena in 1439, consequently
at the time of his elevation to the Papacy
he was sixty-four years of age. The cardinals who
had procured his election in the hope that he would
not survive long were not disappointed, for he died
twenty-seven days after assuming the tiara—so
promptly that the usual rumour of poison immediately
spread. At first it was whispered that
Pandolfo Petrucci, tyrant of Siena, was guilty of
the crime, and later the enemies of Julius II. fancied
they discovered the hand of the Cardinal of San
Pietro ad Vincola in the sudden death. Although
Pandolfo had committed many atrocities, it is
extremely unlikely that any crime in this instance
had been committed. As to Della Rovere, he knew
that the new Pope could not live long, and therefore
had no need to shorten his days; in fact, he had
procured his election for the express purpose of
gaining time to perfect his own plans to secure
the throne of St. Peter.</p>

<p>Caesar had also been active in effecting the
election of Piccolomini, who, in the event of his
elevation, had promised to confirm him in his office
of Captain-General of the Church and Vicar of
Romagna. Immediately after his elevation to the
Papacy the new Pope began to bestow marks of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
his favour upon Valentino. Bonafede, Bishop of
Chiusi, Caesar’s representative during the conclave,
was made Governor of Rome the very day the new
Pontiff was proclaimed.</p>

<p>September 23rd the Pope granted Giustinian an
audience, during which the Venetian ambassador
interceded in favour of the Romagnol barons, who
had returned to their estates. His Holiness
replied: “As far as Cesena is concerned, I agree
perfectly with your Illustrious Signory, but as to
the other lords, God has punished them for their
sins with a <i xml:lang="it" lang="it">tristo</i> instrument, and I wish to remind
the Senate that all the troubles of Italy originated
in Romagna.” Then he said, smiling, “Perhaps
God will restore these lords after they have done
penance.” Undoubtedly the Pontiff had made some
sort of an agreement with Caesar, for he did not
hesitate to maintain the Duke’s rights in Romagna.
He even went so far as to dispatch a legate to
Perugia to break up the league which Valentino’s
enemies had formed against him, and he also sent
commissioners through Romagna to urge the people
to be loyal to him.</p>

<p>Thus enjoying the favour of the new Pope,
Caesar returned to Rome with a considerable
following October 3rd. He was accompanied by
Cardinals Amboise, Sanseverino, and D’Albret.</p>

<p>The Pope, however, did not support Caesar very
actively. In fact, when he urged obedience upon
the Romagnols, he remarked that he would give
the Duke no further aid—he wished, not to be a
warlike Pope, but a pacific one, to bring peace and
quiet to Christendom. Regarding Valentino, the
Pope advised the Republic to do nothing, because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
it would soon be all over with him—his illness
was a punishment from God. The 29th the
ambassador writes: “Valentino has sent messengers
from Nepi to Rome to ask the Pope’s
assistance, but the only result so far is a few
briefs.”</p>

<p>Caesar had only 200 men left; Ugo Moncada
with the flower of his troops had deserted him,
and 2,000 men who had been under the command
of Romolino also left. Alessandro Spanocchi, the
Duke’s treasurer, tried to send money of his for
deposit in Florence, Milan, Bologna, and Ferrara—14,000
to 20,000 ducats. It was said that the
Florentines offered Valentino a free passage
through their territory in case he wished to go
to Romagna.</p>

<p>The following day the Pope issued a brief
threatening with excommunication any one who
should refuse to return any money or other property
removed from the apostolic palace during the illness
of Pope Alexander VI.—evidently this was aimed
at Caesar and his agents.</p>

<p>Nothing escapes Giustinian. “The Duke is still
at Nepi in bad health, and deserted by nearly every
one. The Pope has given him fair words, but
Caesar is distrustful.” October 1st Bartolomeo
d’Alviano requested the Venetian orator to secure
the Senate’s permission for him to attack Caesar in
Nepi; he also informed the ambassador that
Caterina Sforza desired to join in the undertaking
and had promised him a large sum of money, but
he had refused his consent because he would have
been obliged in return to help her recover her
own estates, which would offend Venice. October<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
2nd the orator writes that the Duke of Urbino
had sent a courier to Rome with a letter in which
he said he had attempted, but unsuccessfully, to
persuade the people of Fano, which was in the
possession of Valentino’s forces, to return to the
Holy See—and he asked permission to compel them
to do so. The Cardinal San Pietro ad Vincola
accompanied the messenger and explained all to
his Holiness, who replied that he could not make
any open demonstration against Caesar, but that
he was willing that the Duke of Urbino should do
what he could—that it would not displease him;
which shows that the Pope was willing they should
do as they saw fit with respect to this Duke of
Valence, provided it did not appear to come from
him. The Pope decided Valentino should return
to Rome, and he arranged to put the palace of the
Cardinal of Ferrara near St. Peter’s at his disposal.
His Holiness stated that he could not bring himself
to use extreme measures with respect to the Duke—that
he had decided to have pity on him—however,
“the chief reason why the Pope has been so
indulgent is that he heard the Duke was very ill
and incapable of taking the field, and being by
nature very determined and avaricious, he hopes
in case the Duke dies, without using force, to get
possession of the money and other valuables he
removed from Rome, although I think—and this is
the opinion of many—that in this he will be disappointed,
because the greater part of the valuables
have been taken to the castle of Forli and
the money deposited in various places. The reason
the Duke asked to be allowed to return to Rome is
because he is afraid of Alviano, who is trying in
every way to get his clutches on him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
Valentino entered Rome October 3rd with his
entire force, about 150 men-at-arms, 500 foot-soldiers,
and a few light horse. Burchard’s mention
of Caesar’s return is even more concise.</p>

<p>The Duke was lodged in the palace of the
Cardinal of San Clemente, and many of the high
Church dignitaries immediately called upon him.
“He is still sick,” adds Giustinian, “and it is
thought he will die.” Two days later the orator
writes, perhaps somewhat regretfully: “Valentino
is not as ill as was supposed; he talks arrogantly
and boasts that he will shortly recover all his
domain. To-day the Cardinal of Rouen went to
see him and succeeded in getting 30,000—some
say 50,000—ducats from him. Although the Pope
is not very favourably disposed towards him, Valentino,
to obtain his support, is said to have lent him
a large sum of money for his coronation expenses.
It is believed here that the Pope will regard this
money as his own and keep it, together with the
other valuables collected after the publication of
the brief of excommunication, and also the 24,000
ducats found on deposit in the bank in the name
of the <i xml:lang="it" lang="it">duchetti</i>”—the little Dukes, Don Giovanni
and Don Rodrigo.</p>

<p>The cardinals San Pietro ad Vincola and San
Giorgio complained to the Pope of Caesar’s presence
in the city, and the ambassador reports a
conversation he had with his Holiness, in which the
latter said: “I am neither a saint nor an angel,
but a man, and one who does not fancy that he
knows everything. I have been deceived. I
thought the Duke would ask to be made Captain-General
of the Church, and then I should have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
told him that I had no money for soldiers.” It
was rumoured in Rome that the city of Pesaro
had been captured in the name of Caesar, with the
aid of Florence, and the Duke became more
arrogant and threatening. The French and the
Cardinal of Volterra were scheming to get him
to enter the service of Florence.</p>

<p>The Pope was crowned in St. Peter’s,
October 8th, but the event in comparison with the
actions of Valentino was of slight importance in
the opinion of Giustinian; the Florentines were
negotiating with him, and he was busily engaged
enlisting soldiers for use in Romagna. The agent
of the Duke of Urbino informed the Venetian orator
that Soderini, Cardinal of Volterra, had asked him
in what manner the Republic of Venice had helped
Valentino, and that he had also tried to convince
him that insomuch as Alexander VI. was dead,
there was no reason whatever to accord Caesar
any protection any longer; to which Giustinian
replied that it would be a mistake for Urbino
to second the endeavours of Venice, who was
trying to get possession of Romagna, for in
that case Valentino, France, and the other powers
would take steps against him, and the Duke of
Urbino would lose his domain for the third time;
“then I advised him to make a compact with
Florence and the French.” Urbino was, however,
more inclined toward Venice. The very day
Pius III. was crowned he issued a bull appointing
Caesar Gonfalonier of the Church.</p>

<p>Valentino felt that his star was again in the
ascendant. Favourable reports were coming in
from the Romagna, and about the end of September<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
the people of Cesena had dispatched an
ambassador whom Caesar received graciously and
thanked for the loyalty of his people. Immediately
after the victories of Carpineto and
Martirana, he sent letters to the Romagnols urging
them to resist until he should be well enough to
come to their assistance. The States he had more
recently acquired were somewhat doubtful, but most
of them remained loyal to him. His bitterest
enemy, Giulio Orsini, had made peace with him,
and the Pope gave him permission to embark on
a new campaign to punish Pandolfo Malatesta for
his attempt to seize Rimini, and Sforza for his
movement against Pesaro, and also to chastise the
Duke of Urbino for endeavouring to recover his
own property.</p>

<p>Alvisi publishes a brief issued by the Pope
October 13th, in which he requests the Florentines
to allow Caesar, “whom he loves tenderly,
paternally, on account of his rare and superior
virtues,” to lead his army through their territory.</p>

<p>It is difficult to judge how sincere the Pope was,
but it is certain that all Italy, except Romagna,
feared and hated Caesar, and rejoiced in his downfall;
many were afraid that he might rise again;
every one was eager to betray him; Ferrara, in
spite of Lucretia Borgia’s marriage with Alfonso
d’Este, hated him—the daughter of a dead Pope
was of slight account in Italian politics. The
Romagnol barons had entered into a treaty with
him, but had no intention of keeping it. Bartolomeo
d’Alviano and Baglioni were gathering an
army to crush him, and, in conjunction with the
Orsini, were trying to get possession of his person;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
shortly after his return to Rome his enemies
entered into a solemn compact to pursue him to
the death. Even Spain’s representative in Naples,
Gonsalvo de Cordova, signed the agreement.</p>

<p>Annibale Bentivoglio came to Rome early in
October ostensibly to do homage to the Pope, but
in reality to watch Caesar’s movements. The Holy
Father told Bentivoglio he had written the briefs
in Caesar’s favour in good faith, but that henceforth
he would do nothing for him—but at the same
time he was careful to add that he would do nothing
to injure him. Dissatisfied with this, Bentivoglio
asked Cardinal della Rovere to get the Pope’s permission
for him to attack Caesar. This the cardinal
promised to endeavour to do, and Riario
likewise agreed to use his influence to this end.</p>

<p>In the meantime Valentino’s forces were rapidly
dwindling away; of the 6,000 foot-soldiers and
600 men-at-arms he had at the time of his
father’s death, not half were left to him. The
clouds were fast gathering; even the Florentines,
who pretended to be his friends, were more than
suspicious of him. Gonsalvo de Cordova promulgated
an edict forbidding the Spanish captains to
serve under Caesar’s orders, and commanding them
immediately to report to himself to check Louis XII.,
who was advancing on Naples; October 14th the
edict, in the name of Castile, was solemnly proclaimed
in Rome before Valentino’s palace and in
two other places. Small companies of men under
the lieutenants of Alviano, of Baglioni, and Orsini
were constantly being brought to Rome. The Pope
held a conference with the ambassadors of the
various powers, and asked them to put a stop to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
Alviano’s operations in the Romagna; this they
diplomatically declined to do.</p>

<p>Caesar’s palace was surrounded; it was impossible
for him to escape. In case he attempted to
flee by way of Ostia, Mottino, formerly captain of
Alexander’s galleys, was ready to pounce upon him,
and Giustinian says: “This Alviano is like a mad
dog determined to fly at his throat.”</p>

<p>Valentino, however, bribed the guards at the
Porta Viridaria, and Burchard records that he
escaped with all his men October 15th, but that
some of his people immediately deserted and returned
to Rome. When Orsini heard of his flight
he hurriedly left the city by another gate, and
Caesar, finding his road cut off, returned to Rome,
where he was admitted to the Vatican. All but
seventy of his men-at-arms abandoned him, and
they, together with a few foot-soldiers, acted as
a guard before the palace.</p>

<p>On the ground that he was a common criminal
the Orsini protested to the Pope against affording
him any protection.</p>

<p>Rome was on the verge of civil war; the Orsini
burnt the Torrione gate, and Fabio Orsini and
Renzo di Ceri were ordered to attack the Borgo
which Caesar had fortified. With the Torrione
gate destroyed, it was easy to get into the Vatican.
Valentino was driven to the wall, when Cardinals
Borgia, Salerno, Sorento, and Arborea had him
conducted through the subterranean passage to
Hadrian’s Mole, where for a time at least he was
safe. With him he had his natural children and
the little Dukes of Nepi and of Sermoneta. His
palace in the Borgo was sacked and plundered.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
October 16th Giustinian tersely records: “The
Duke has retreated to castle S. Angelo with four
or five servants; his people are scattered; the
Orsini have surrounded the castle; they are trying
to persuade the Spanish ambassador to take steps
to prevent him getting away.”</p>

<p>At the same time the Spanish cardinals were
endeavouring to induce the warder to permit Valentino
to escape disguised as a friar. But the Orsini
were vigilant and took every precaution to prevent
this. Caesar was deserted by all his people; what
little property he had managed to save was now
gone; the captain of the guard, a nephew of the
Pope, secured the greater part of it, and even the
magnificent Bartolomeo d’Alviano obtained two
beautiful chargers; all was scattered and Valentino
was in sore straits.</p>

<p>The Orsini, finding themselves baffled, instituted
a civil suit against their enemy for seizing the
estates of the barons, and demanded that he be
held in the castle of St. Angelo until a decision
could be rendered.</p>

<p>To some extent Caesar still enjoyed the favour
of the Pope, and he conceived the idea of escaping
by night and joining Michelotto at the castle of
Soriana, where, he believed, he might collect an
army and recover Romagna. He, however, had no
chance to carry out this plan, for the one friend
still left—if friend he could be called—Pope
Pius III., died during the night of October 18,
1503, thus promptly fulfilling the hopes and expectations
of many of the cardinals. Piccolomini had
reigned just twenty-seven days. September 27th
he had undergone a painful operation, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
Venetian ambassador followed his illness day by
day as closely as he had done that of his predecessor.
October 16th he states that fears for the
Pontiff’s life were felt; he was worse the next
day and during the night his brothers removed
his valuables from the Vatican to a place of safety.
The Orsini, determined to force the election of a
Pope of their choice when Pius passed away,
remained in Rome.</p>

<p>When Alexander VI. died, the most scurrilous
epitaphs were found affixed to the palace walls,
but when Pius III. passed away, numerous laudatory
epigrams were discovered. Angelo Colucci
drew a striking comparison of the short but respectable
reign of Piccolomini and the shameless
pontificate of his predecessor.</p>

<p>The death of Pius was a great blow to Caesar,
who had enjoyed his support for a time. Even
now, however, his courage did not entirely desert
him. Machiavelli, who arrived in Rome October
26th, wrote the Signory that the Duke was
more hopeful than ever of accomplishing great
things—providing a friendly Pope is elected. It
was said that Caesar finally despairing of any other
aid, had made some sort of a compact with the
Cardinal of San Giorgio.</p>

<p>The Sacred College, after seriously considering
the demands of the Orsini that Caesar be held until
a new Pope was elected, decided that they had no
authority to do so. During the meeting the Cardinal
of Rouen defended Caesar, hoping thereby
to secure the support of the Spanish prelates who
were still devoted to Valentino and were themselves
influential and united. The cardinals decided that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
the Duke was at liberty to go and come as he
saw fit. There was, however, little likelihood that
he would leave, as he was safer where he was
than he would be anywhere else; moreover, when
the new Pope should be elected he would be
in the best possible position to secure his
favour through the mediation of the cardinals
who might remain loyal to him. How influential
Caesar still was is shown by the orator’s remark
that all those who aspired to the Pontificate
were ready to promise him anything he asked
to secure the votes of the Spanish cardinals and
“there is one thing certain,” he adds: “no one will
be Pope who does not consent to all of Valentino’s
demands.”</p>

<p>The Spanish prelates seemed to favour the astute
Cardinal of San Pietro ad Vincola, but Santa Prassede
and Alexandrino were also strong candidates.</p>

<p>Burchard records that the Cardinal of San
Pietro ad Vincola came to the apostolic palace
October 29th with Valentino and his Spanish cardinals,
and entered into an agreement with them
by which he promised, when he became Pope, to
make Caesar Captain-General of the Church, and
also to protect his interests and restore him to his
estates; the Duke on his part was to aid Della
Rovere in the conclave, and all the Spanish cardinals
promised to cast their votes for him. The
evening of October 30th, the obsequies of the
deceased Pope being over, the cardinals agreed
among themselves that the Cardinal of San Pietro
ad Vincola should be his successor. The same
day Machiavelli informed his Signory that Giuliano
della Rovere had secured the promise of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
majority of the votes of the Sacred College “by
means adapted to this end.”</p>

<p>Giustinian repeats the various rumours current
regarding the momentous event, the election of the
new Pope. The very day of the Pontiff’s death
he wrote: “There are three strong candidates—Naples,
San Pietro ad Vincola, and San Giorgio;
the Spaniards incline to the second because he will
be able to satisfy their demands the best. The
Cardinal of Naples may get a few votes, but he
is suspected of being French. San Giorgio’s age
is against him, consequently Della Rovere is the
strongest candidate. Sforza, Colonna, and Rouen
are not mentioned now.”</p>

<p>The day following the Pope’s decease all the
cardinals were “intent on their machinations, some
with little respect to God and the dignity of their
office. Bargains are openly made; the terms are
no longer in hundreds, but in thousands and tens
of thousands—to the measureless shame of our
religion, and insult to God; there is now no difference
between the Papacy and the Sultanate—it will
go to the highest bidder.”</p>

<p>October 22nd the Orsini complained to the
Sacred College of their treatment and Alessandrino
and Medici were delegated to confer with them and
Caesar. The Orsini, feeling that they had been
grievously wronged, and at the same time not
wanting to oppose the Holy See and the Sacred
College, promised that if the Duke would leave
Italy and go to France or some other place they
would allow him safe passage; on the other hand,
if he desired to remain in Italy in the Province of
Gesia, they demanded that he be required to give<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
security for his appearance before the future Pope
to answer the charges lodged against him; they
also agreed to give bonds to appear and defend
an action he had threatened to bring against them.
“It is not known what Caesar said to these suggestions;
many think he will decide to go to France,
but some say he will remain here.” The next day
the orator heard that Valentino had resolved to
leave Italy, and that he had asked for eight or
ten days in which to make his preparations; he also
demanded that the Orsini be required to leave
Rome and to give him a safe-conduct as they
had agreed. It is clear that he asked for this time
to enable him to persuade the Sacred College to
force the Orsini to leave Rome and also to permit
him to carry on his machinations in connection
with the election.</p>

<p>The obsequies of the deceased Pope continued,
but attracted little attention, the impending election
of his successor being the all-absorbing topic—while
the electioneering proceeded and the scandal
increased.</p>

<p>Cardinal Colonna went over to the Spanish faction,
and this again rendered the situation more
complicated. The 27th of the month the Venetian
ambassador wrote that it was still uncertain who
would secure the great prize. The cardinals of
Naples and San Pietro ad Vincola were now the
leading candidates; Ascanio Sforza was also mentioned.
The ambassador adds that while “the
wishes of the King of France have some weight,
the Duke’s desires are more important than anything
else—and may God save us from having a
Pope who, under obligations to Valentino, may convulse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>
the affairs of all Italy and even of all
Christendom.”</p>

<p>Reports reached Rome that Antonio Ordelaffi
had captured Forli and that Sforza had recovered
Pesaro; at the same time Pandolfo Petrucci had
entered Rimini, taken the fortress, and put Caesar’s
men to rout; this renewed activity was directly
due to the Pope’s death and Caesar’s retreat to
the Castle of St Angelo.</p>

<p>The Duke was greatly discouraged by this news
and dispatched a messenger to the Venetian ambassador
to ask the help of the Senate. By this
time Alviano and the Orsini had, in obedience to
the wishes of the cardinals, left Rome with nearly
all their troops.</p>

<p>The Pope’s obsequies were concluded the 29th.
Giampaolo Baglioni was still in Rome under the
protection of the Cardinal of Rouen, who stated
he desired his presence for his own security. The
Sacred College, however, to render this unnecessary,
enlisted about five hundred foot-soldiers to
guard the conclave. Caesar was still in the Castle of
St. Angelo and daily received visits from Cardinals
Borgia, Loris, Romolino, and Vera to confer regarding
the future Pope.</p>

<p>Although Valentino had received the safe-conduct
he made no move to depart; in fact, he had
no intention of going before the election of the
new Pope. The morning of the 30th it became
known that Della Rovere had reached an agreement
with the Spanish cardinals and Rouen, and
his election was assured. The betting, according to
Giustinian, ran as high as 82 per cent. on Della
Rovere as against 6 per cent. on the field—just how
bets were placed in those days is not known.</p>

<p class="in0"><span class="pfirst">The</span> last day of October the cardinals entered
into conclave, and November 1, 1503, Giuliano
della Rovere, Cardinal of San Pietro ad Vincola,
was elected Pope on the first scrutiny. Thus
the nephew of Sixtus IV., after nineteen years of
waiting, aspiring, scheming, years of exile, of
strife, of hopes and fears, realised the ambition of
his life.</p>

<p>At the fifteenth hour the window was thrown
open, the cross held out, and the announcement
made that the most reverend Cardinal of San Pietro
ad Vincola had been elected supreme head of the
Christian Church. The new Pope was pleased to
assume the name Julius II.</p>

<p>Giustinian conceives that Venice will profit by
the election of Della Rovere, who was reputed to
be a man of his word. He was sixty years of
age and had no nephews for whom it would be
necessary to find places. Caesar therefore felt sure
of the new Pontiff’s favour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
Almost immediately after Della Rovere’s election
chambers over the audience-hall were, by the Pope’s
orders, placed at Valentino’s disposal, and there
he took up his residence.</p>

<p>The Venetian orator had heard that the new Pope
had dispatched briefs to Romagna of the same
tenor as those which Pius III. had issued in the
interests of Valentino, and he went to the Pontiff
and asked whether the report was true, to which
his Holiness replied: “Ambassador, do not for
a moment think that I will fail in anything I have
promised you; I give you my word that I have
written no such briefs, and I do not intend to do
so, and” he added, “even if I had written them
you know I would at the same time have taken
steps to prevent them from doing any harm”—that
is, he would have given those to whom they
were sent to understand that they were not to be
observed—modern politics has made but little
advance in duplicity. “It is true Agapito has
asked me to write them, but I will do nothing.
Ambassador, it is not necessary for you to remind
me that we should not favour the Duke in the
affairs of Romagna, because this is our office, this
territory being ours, <i xml:lang="it" lang="it">mediate vel immediate</i>; therefore
whoever holds it holds it as a vicar or feudatory
of the Church.”</p>

<p>The Pope’s coronation was set for November
19th, and as early as the 3rd Giustinian was
informed that Julius had written Guidobaldo di
Montefeltre, Duke of Urbino, requesting him to
be present at the ceremony. This special invitation
shows that the new Pope was on the side of Caesar’s
enemies. Although the Cardinal of San Giorgio<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>
feared that if Guidobaldo absented himself from
his State it would afford Caesar a chance to injure
him, it can hardly be supposed that the Pope
invited the Duke of Urbino to Rome simply to give
Valentino an opportunity to destroy him or attack
his capital city.</p>

<p>It is difficult to see how Caesar, himself a past-master
in duplicity and cunning, could have placed
any dependence upon the promises Della Rovere
had made to him to secure his elevation to the
Papacy. Just what were the terms of the bargain
is not known; the cardinal had but one end in
view—the assuring of his own election; and once
elected, he would not hesitate to break the agreement
he had made. It is true he carried out some
of the stipulations by appointing Valentino Captain-General
of the Church and guaranteeing him the
nominal possession of Romagna, but the very day
of his election he began to aid and encourage the
Duke’s enemies.</p>

<p>Alexander VI. had urged the Sacred College
never to make Giuliano della Rovere pope, and
he was correct in regarding him as an implacable
enemy of his House. Caesar himself almost immediately
discovered that he had made a mistake and
was on his guard. November 12th the Pope formally
took possession of the Castle of St. Angelo,
placing the Bishop of Sinigaglia in command of it.</p>

<p>The following day a council was held by the
Pope, Amboise, Soderini, the Cardinal of Ferrara,
the Spanish cardinals, and Caesar, regarding the
departure of Valentino, and it was agreed that he
should at once go to Ferrara and his troops to
Imola, which was still held by his lieutenants. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
Duke, however, seemed suspicious and irresolute—perhaps
owing to a sort of stupor into which he
had been thrown by the reverses he had suffered—for
he was neither accustomed to misfortunes nor
able to bear them.</p>

<p>Giustinian writes November 6th: “The Duke
is still in the palace but has little reputation; he
made every effort to obtain an audience with his
Holiness but failed. He is very submissive and
has repeatedly sent to ask me to come and confer
with him regarding his affairs, but I declined, for
various reasons, among them being the fact that
he quite ignored the Republic during his days of
prosperity.” Caesar continued to enlist troops but
with what end in view is not clear.</p>

<p>The Cardinal of Cosenza told the orator that his
Holiness was considering an alliance between one
of his great-nieces and the little Duke of Camerino.
It was also reported that the Pope intended to
give Caesar the strong Castle of Civita Castellana
for his residence, but this statement was not
confirmed.</p>

<p>It was even arranged that when the proposal
should be made in consistory to give the office
of Gonfalonier of the Church to Valentino it should
be merely for form’s sake to satisfy him. About
the middle of November it became known that
Cesena desired to be freed from Caesar’s authority
and return to that of the Church. The Pope’s
coronation was postponed for a week “on the
advice of the astrologers, who stated that the stars
would be more propitious for his Holiness that
day.”</p>

<p>“The Pope is most harshly disposed towards the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
Duke, and it is said has ordered Pandolfo Petrucci
to treat him as an enemy; his Holiness looks for
Caesar’s destruction, but does not want it to appear
that he has any part in it.”</p>

<p>Julius II. had conceived the idea of recovering
the strongholds in the Romagna for himself, and
he soon discovered that Caesar actually expected
to retain them. The Borgia, shrewd as he was, was
no match for the Della Rovere in cunning; the
Pope outwitted him at every turn, and he did not
hesitate to tell Giustinian that “the Duke shall
never have so much as a single tower of my
fortresses. All I owe him is to save his life and
protect his property—in interceding for him with
the Florentines it was really to save Romagna for
the Church.” The Pope told the orator that as
soon as he had secured possession of the castles
he would send Caesar away. Clearly his Holiness
did not want to be compelled to use force to get
possession of the strongholds; he was trying to
delude Caesar into giving them up, and then he
would cast him aside.</p>

<p>The orator confesses that the Pope’s mind
is “ambiguous” to him—<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">me ambigua</i>—but he
promptly discovered that he wanted to crush
the Duke, and this view was confirmed by many
of those in the Pope’s confidence; some, however,
maintained that he was well disposed toward
Valentino.</p>

<p>November 19th occurred the event to which all
had been eagerly looking forward—Caesar’s departure
from Rome. He went to Ostia, where he
was met by Mottino with two galleys to take him
to Tuscany. There were various rumours regarding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>
the place where he intended to disembark; the
Venetian orator was told that Viareggio, a town
belonging to the Duke of Ferrara, was his
destination. He had with him about 160 horse.</p>

<p>Valentino was greatly changed when Machiavelli
saw him in Rome, and both he and Giustinian
regarded Caesar as lost; the latter saw him “fearful
and terrified,” while Machiavelli wrote: “The
Duke allows himself to be carried away by his
confident mind”; he also said Valentino was
“changeable, irresolute, and suspicious.”</p>

<p>Worn out by his reverses, he had at first thought
of going to Romagna. But when he embarked he
had decided to go either to Livorno or Genoa and
thence to Ferrara. Machiavelli, who had assured
him that Florence would grant him a safe conduct,
said that if the Signory failed him “Caesar would
make a compact with the Venetians and the devil
and would go to Pisa and devote all the money,
forces, and allies that remained to him to injuring
the Republic.”</p>

<p>The 18th, the very day that Caesar left the
Palace, Julius II. dispatched briefs to Romagna in
which he said he had disapproved of the bestowal
of the vicariate upon Valentino by Alexander VI.,
and he exhorted the people to raise the standard
of the Church, in whose possession he intended
Romagna should remain. A few days later he told
Cardinal Soderini that it would have been wiser,
he thought, to have placed the strongholds of
Romagna under Caesar’s command, as it would
be better for him than for the Venetians to have
them. Soderini went to Ostia and made certain
proposals to Caesar, which were rejected. November<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
24th the Pope ordered Mottino to hold Valentino,
and at the same time he arranged with Soderini
to impede the progress of Michelotto, who had
started forward with the Duke’s cavalry. The same
day he appointed the Bishop of Ragusa, Giovanni
Sacchi, Governor of Romagna and Bologna, and
directed him to take possession of the province in
the name of the Church, and he again called upon
the cities to raise the papal standard.</p>

<p>The general opinion in Rome was that Julius II.
was only waiting for a more favourable opportunity
to give Caesar the final blow, and the joy
felt at his departure was wellnigh universal.
Agapito and Romolino, his two closest friends, men
whose names had been connected with some of his
most atrocious crimes, had refused to accompany
him and remained in Rome.</p>

<p>The Pope had also instructed Soderini to demand
the surrender of the citadel of Forli, and Caesar’s
refusal to comply was what caused his Holiness
to seize him and hold him prisoner.</p>

<p>Machiavelli reported to his Government the
rumours which filled Rome when Caesar’s arrest
became known; it was even said that his Holiness
had ordered him to be flung into the Tiber, and he
adds: “If this has not been done it will be done
shortly, in my opinion; we see that the Pope has
commenced to pay his debts very honourably; his
pen and ink are all that are necessary—nevertheless
his praise is in all men’s mouths!”</p>

<p>The night of November 27th the papal guard
set out for Ostia to arrest Caesar, but they did not
have to proceed far, for, searching the boats they
chanced to come upon, they found him on a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>
little craft on the Tiber about two miles from
Rome.</p>

<p>The troops he had embarked at Ostia, finding
themselves without a head, left the galleys and
went back to Rome, while the gentlemen of his
suite returned to their estates.</p>

<p>At first the Pope had Caesar taken to Magliano,
a place about seven miles from Rome, where he
was closely guarded, but not treated harshly.
Julius undoubtedly wished to avoid the use of force
with Caesar as far as possible and to secure his
own ends peaceably if it could be done. He may
have feared that if he too openly disclosed his real
purpose Valentino’s lieutenants would surrender the
castles they still held to some other power, for
several were casting longing eyes upon them. Later
the Pope ordered Valentino to be brought back
to Rome and had him lodged in the Vatican.</p>

<p>Giustinian informs his Government, November
28th, that the Pontiff, to justify himself for
arresting Caesar, especially in the eyes of the
Spanish cardinals, held a convocation, which was
attended by fifteen cardinals, to whom he explained
that as Venice had been active in Romagna, not
against the Church or the Holy See, but only against
Valentino, and also to restrain the Florentines, who
appeared to have designs upon the same territory,
he had decided to remove the cause, in order that
the Republic would have no pretext for going any
farther. Therefore he had given the Duke to
understand that he must surrender the territory
now in his possession into the hands of the
Pope and must give the countersigns of the
fortresses; but for fear that he would not give<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>
the true countersigns it seemed advisable to his
Holiness to have the Duke brought to Rome
and kept in a safe place until their correctness
could be verified. This done, the Duke
could go whithersoever he wished. All seemed
satisfied. The 29th Valentino was brought back
to Rome and lodged in the chambers of the
Cardinal of Salerno. “The Pope says that when
he has secured possession of the strongholds he
will permit him to depart—but God knows what
will become of him,” adds the orator.</p>

<p>The 1st of December news reached Rome that
Michelotto had been captured and all his men slain
or dispersed by Giampaolo Baglioni somewhere
between Perugia and Florence. This was a crushing
blow to Caesar, who now had little hope
left—he was “no longer considered of much
importance.”</p>

<p>At this time the Cardinal of Rouen was making
preparations to leave Rome for the Court of the
Emperor at Florence, and Caesar desired to go
with him, but to this the cardinal would not consent.
Before Amboise set out the Pope commanded
Valentino to send one of his officers, Pedro
de Oviedo, accompanied by a prelate, to obtain
the surrender of the places his supporters were
still holding in Romagna, but before consenting
Caesar asked Amboise to give him a guarantee in
writing that the Pope would keep the promises he
had made to him before the conclave. Amboise,
however, refused to do this, and after the Cardinal’s
departure the Duke, finding his last support taken
from him, acceded to the Pope’s demands. The
commandant of Caesar, however, thinking or pretending<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>
to think there was treachery, seized
the unfortunate Oviedo and hanged him from
the battlements forthwith as a traitor to his
sovereign.</p>

<p>When he learned of this the Pope was beside
himself—in fact, as Carlo da Moncalieri expressed
it, he was “mad as the devil”—<i xml:lang="it" lang="it">alterato come il
diavolo</i>—and threatened to put Caesar in prison
for life. Believing that he had found some way
to tell the commandant to disregard the order he
had given, the Pope had Valentino confined in the
Borgia Tower. He nevertheless continued to treat
with him, and again allowed him to go to Ostia,
this time in charge of the Spanish Cardinal
Carvajal, with the understanding that he was to
be given his liberty when his officers surrendered
the strongholds in Romagna.</p>

<p>Giustinian records the hanging of Oviedo December
20th and Caesar’s transfer to the Borgia
Tower, and adds: “Terrified by recent events, the
Cardinal of Sorento and Cardinal Borgia have left
the city—possibly to go to the Spanish camp. It is
believed by many that their flight was due to Valentino’s
affairs or because they had acquiesced in
the poisoning of Cardinal Sant Angelo.” When
the Cardinals Francesco Romolino and Francesco
Borgia fled to Naples with the little Dukes to ask
Gonsalvo of Cordova for protection Vannozza and
the Borgia ilk were trying to save their plunder.
Much of it was intercepted and seized when they
endeavoured to send it from the city to a place of
safety. Some of the wagons dispatched from Rome
to Ferrara in the name of the Cardinal d’Este
were stopped by the Florentines, while others<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>
from Cesena were captured by Giovanni Bentivoglio.</p>

<p>Caesar was wellnigh ruined when an event
occurred which immediately restored the waning
influence of the Spanish cardinals with the Pope,
who was a French sympathiser, and this was the
victory of Gonsalvo de Cordova at the Garigliano,
December 31st, which finally assured the Regno
to the Spanish crown.</p>

<p>For some time Valentino was partly forgotten,
but he was still in the Vatican as late as January 15,
1504, and was planning to go to Ferrara, although
Alfonso d’Este was by no means anxious to have
him. Just what was to be done with him was a
puzzling question. It was finally decided to send
him to Civitavecchia in the custody of the Cardinal
of Santa Croce, and the Pope told the Venetian
orator that he wished to make one more attempt
to reach a settlement in order that he might be
able to justify himself in the eyes of the world
for the steps he would be compelled to take against
Valentino if the latter failed to keep the promises
he had made to him.</p>

<p>January 18th, through the mediation of Don
Diego de Mendoza, the Spanish ambassador, it was
arranged that Caesar should give the countersigns
of all the castles still remaining to him, and that
he himself should go to Ostia in the custody of
the Cardinal of Santa Croce and then, when the
strongholds were surrendered, he should be allowed
to depart for France. There was some delay in
carrying out the agreement, due to recent events
in Forli and Imola, but February 14, 1504, the
Duke set out for Ostia, and in taking leave of him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>
his Holiness “caressed him and promised him his
support.”</p>

<p>The Pope was suffering from the gout, which
appears to have been essentially a papal disease
at that time, and had remained in bed the greater
part of the day. Valentino, accompanied by a few
of his own people and Francesco del Rio, the Pope’s
treasurer, set out for Ostia the same night.
According to Giustinian, while there he was closely
guarded, and consequently greatly annoyed.</p>

<p>The commissioners, who had been furnished the
new countersigns, had in the meantime again gone
to Romagna, but they did not succeed in securing
possession of the strongholds, for the warders of
Cesena and Bertinoro, distrusting the Pope’s
promises, dispatched messengers to Rome to tell
him they would surrender the strongholds if he
would release the Duke, but in case he was not
willing to set Valentino free “they could not
honourably relinquish the castles,” on hearing
which his Holiness fell into a violent passion and
shouted at them: “You want to brazen it out.
Away with you! If you don’t give them up peaceably
I will make you. You wanted to surrender
them to the Venetians, but they would not have
them!” And he drove the messengers from the
room.</p>

<p>Mottino, who was to take Caesar to France on
one of his galleys, had been directed by the Holy
Father not to leave port, even after the strongholds
had been surrendered to the Pope’s representatives,
until he received specific orders to do so.</p>

<p>The Cardinal of Santa Croce, however, when
messengers brought the news that Cesena and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>
Bertinoro had been surrendered, did not wait for
definite orders from the Pope to set his prisoner
free, but let him go February 26th, after obtaining
his written promise never to take part in any
war against the Holy Father or any of his kinsmen.</p>

<p>Caesar and two of his people took horse, and,
following the coast, rode to Naples, where he joined
Gonsalvo de Cordova, from whom Cardinals Borgia
and Romolino had previously secured a safe-conduct
for the Duke. At Naples several of his family
were awaiting him, among them his brother Giuffre
and his sister-in-law Sancia.</p>

<p>About the middle of April Giustinian informed
his Government that the affairs of Valentino, so
far as the Pope was concerned, were settled, and
there were no further difficulties to be apprehended.</p>

<p>April 20th the Pope received a letter from
Mottino informing him that Caesar had left Ostia
and was on his way to Naples. His Holiness was
much disturbed by this news and immediately sent
a messenger to summon the French ambassador.
The Cardinal of Salerno informed the Venetian
orator that the Cardinal of Santa Croce, fearing
that the Pope, even after the strongholds had been
surrendered, would on some pretext refuse Valentino
his liberty, had immediately set him free. The
Pope was greatly annoyed by Santa Croce’s action
and charged him with breach of faith. The orator
adds: “Many are pleased by Caesar’s departure,
but others are greatly displeased. Opinions differ
as to what Valentino will do; some think he will
cause the Pope trouble.” His Holiness evidently
had not intended Valentino should get away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
In a letter to the Cardinal of Salerno, received
in Rome May 3rd, Caesar said he had not yet had
an opportunity to speak to the Spanish commander;
he also asked the cardinal to supply him with funds,
which the prelate promptly did.</p>

<p>When Baldassare di Scipione arrived in Rome
from Naples he reported that Gonsalvo had received
Caesar in the most cordial manner and had called
on him, as all the other Spanish officers had done.
Rome was filled with rumours regarding the coming
of Caesar by the favour of the Spaniards to help
the Pisans.</p>

<p>When the Roman barons in the Spanish army
at the Garigliano learned of the death of Piero de’
Medici they began to take a lively interest in the
affairs of Tuscany and decided to send forces there;
while the Florentines, disturbed by the military
preparations about Siena, had sent assistance to
the Lord of Piombino, who felt his people were
opposed to him. Bartolomeo d’Alviano was to have
had charge of the forces which were to be dispatched
to Tuscany, but Gonsalvo preferred Caesar
on account of the friends upon whom he could
still count in Piombino and Pisa. Early in May
active preparations were well under way. In Rome
Baldassare di Scipione publicly stated that his lord
“would soon return and give his enemies cause to
think of him.” The Pisans sent an ambassador to
Caesar and he dispatched Ranieri della Sassetta
with a considerable force to them. Giulio degli
Alberini was waiting in the harbour of Naples to
transport the cannons and other machines of war;
everything was ready and the main body of troops
was to start in a few days, when, on the night of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>
May 26th, as Valentino was coming from a conference
with the Spanish captains, he was arrested
by the castellan, Nugnio Campeio.</p>

<p>The Pope had sent a special envoy to Gonsalvo
de Cordova to urge him not to assist Valentino in
any way; and there is no doubt whatever that
it was at the instigation of the Holy Father that
the Duke was finally again seized. The very night
that Valentino was arrested the Pope, thinking that
the Duke’s treasurer, Alessandro di Franzo, who
was then in Rome, and had in his possession about
300,000 ducats, which he was about to remove to
Naples, might endeavour to leave, had guards
stationed at all the gates of the city and allowed
no one to depart. All the following day the gates
were kept closed and watched by the papal troops.
During the night the Governor of Rome had patrols
about the city and all suspected persons were
arrested and examined. Even the house of
Madonna Vannozza, Caesar’s mother, was carefully
searched.</p>

<p>May 29th Giustinian states that, accompanied by
Cardinal Grimani, he went to the Castle of St.
Angelo to see the Pope, who informed them that the
Bishop of Cervia had shown him letters from the
Great Captain, saying that Valentino, having in
mind certain undertakings which would be harmful
to Italy, had, by his orders, been confined in the
castle, and also requesting that his Holiness be
informed of the fact.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span>
Opinions differed as to the responsibility for
Caesar’s arrest; some said the Pope caused it,
others the Spanish monarch, and still others that
Gonsalvo do Cordova took the step on his own
initiative. Some even ascribed the affair to the
Queen of Spain and Doña Maria Enriquez, widow
of Giovanni, Duke of Gandia. The Pope made no
effort to conceal his pleasure at the arrest and
displayed marked evidence of his favour to the
Spanish ambassador, assuring him of his devotion
to his sovereign—“it was judged,” adds the
orator, “to induce him to compass the death of the
said Valentino!”</p>

<p>His brother, the Prince of Squillace, was also
arrested about the same time but almost immediately
set at liberty. Caesar’s messengers were likewise
seized when they chanced to come within reach
of the determined Julius.</p>

<p>Michelotto, who was closely confined in the Torre
di Nona awaiting trial, was subjected to searching
examinations regarding the deaths of numerous
persons, principal among whom were the Duke of
Gandia; Giulio Cesare Varano, Lord of Camerino,
and his two sons, Piero and Venanzio, who were
captured when Camerino surrendered and later
were strangled by Valentino’s orders; the Lord of
Faenza, Astorre Manfredi and his illegitimate
brother, Giovanni Evangelista; the Duke of
Bisceglia, Lucretia Borgia’s second husband; Bernardino
Gaetani da Sermoneta, slain by Caesar’s
orders in 1500, about the same time that Alexander
caused the death in the Castle of St. Angelo of
Giacomo Gaetani, the head of the House, seizing
their estates and conferring them on his daughter
Lucretia; and the Bishop of Cagli, who was
hanged in the public square for his brave resistance
to Valentino’s lieutenants in 1503.</p>

<p>Caesar’s arrest so pleased his Holiness that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>
spoke of it as <i xml:lang="it" lang="it">un’ opera divina</i>—although it was
brought about by himself.</p>

<p>August 20th Gonsalvo had Caesar taken to
Spain by sea and by a refinement of cruelty his
jailer on the trip was his bitterest enemy, Prospero
Colonna.</p>

<p>Valentino was destined never again to see the
peninsula, and it is no exaggeration to say that all
Italy breathed easier when it became known that he
was a prisoner on board a galley bound for Spain.</p>

<p>The faithful Baldassare di Scipione, inspired by
love for his imprisoned lord, issued a challenge
addressed to “any Spaniard who might dare to
maintain: That the Duke Valentino had not been
made a prisoner in Naples in violation of the safe-conduct
of King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella,
and owing to their utter want of faith, and all to
their eternal infamy and everlasting shame”—and
the challenge was exposed in public places throughout
Christendom, and never a Spaniard dared reply.</p>

<p>For a long time Romagna suffered for want of
a strong governing hand; the country was being
ruined by rival factions, the cities were deserted,
and many there were who regretted the overthrow
of Valentino.</p>

<p>With Caesar’s removal to Spain his influence
in the affairs of Italy became negligible. In fact,
since that time the Borgia family has been inconspicuous
in the history of the peninsula.</p>

<p>About this time an event occurred in the Vatican
which was duly chronicled by Burchard—the betrothal
of Niccolò della Rovere and Donna Laura,
the illegitimate daughter of Alexander VI. by Giulia
Farnese. Gregorovius remarks that the consent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>
of Julius II. to the union of his nephew with his
enemy’s natural daughter is one of the most extraordinary
facts in the personal history of this Pope.
It looks like a pledge of reconciliation with the
Borgia. While these men were his opponents Julius
had hated them, but his hostility was not based
on any moral grounds. He had never felt any contempt
for Alexander or Caesar, but on the contrary,
like Machiavelli, he had admired their power and
ability. They were his enemies because they tried
to crush him and frustrate his ambitions, and he
retaliated.</p>

<p>July 10th the Pope informed the Venetian orator
that Gonsalvo had proposed to aid Caesar with
men and cannon in his undertaking against the Lord
of Piombino on account of the latter’s opposition
to the Spaniards, but that, dissatisfied with this,
Valentino had endeavoured to disarrange the Great
Captain’s plans, and had engaged in his customary
scheming—this was the cause of his arrest—and
“God had so ordained it on account of his misdeeds—inducing
others to do what we were unwilling
to do.”</p>

<p>Ten days later his Holiness informed the Venetian
ambassador that Caesar had been sent to Spain
carefully guarded and with a single servant. He
added that certain cardinals had urged him to write
a letter to his Catholic Majesty in Caesar’s behalf
and that he had promised to do so, but he feared
even if he merely recommended protection for
Caesar’s life and person, his letter would be misconstrued
and the King would show him greater
favour than he had intended, and might even undertake
to recover for him a part, if not all, of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>
estates, which would be dangerous to himself; he
therefore had revoked the order to write the brief,
and “I assured his Holiness that he was most
prudent and circumspect—and with this I took my
leave.”</p>

<p>Caesar reached Valentia about the end of September
and thence he was immediately transferred
to Chinchilla, which is about two leagues from the
town of Albacete in the province of the same name.</p>

<p>Little is known of his sojourn here, but a document
now in the archives of Pau shows that he
was still there as late as May 4, 1505, eight months
after his arrival in Spain.</p>

<p>Abandoned by every one, Caesar endeavoured
to secure the dowry of 100,000 livres which had
been promised by Louis XII. on the occasion of
his marriage with Charlotte d’Albret.</p>

<p>In October letters came from Spain describing
the rigour with which Valentino was held prisoner.
It was even said that at the instigation of Doña
Maria Enriquez he was to be tried there for
the murder of her husband, the Duke of Gandia,
and for that of his brother-in-law, Alfonso of
Bisceglia, with the intention of putting him to death
for his crimes. Early in 1505 news reached Italy
that Valentino’s brother-in-law, Jean d’Albret, King
of Navarre, was endeavouring to secure his release.
The cardinals who were still loyal to him believed
D’Albret would succeed, Caesar’s most determined
enemy, the Queen of Spain, having died.</p>

<p>It is recorded that while he was confined in
the castle of Chinchilla Caesar attempted to kill
the warder, Gabriel Guzman. One day Valentino,
who was lodged in the high tower, asked for an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>
interview with Don Gabriel, and while they were
engaged in conversation the Duke suddenly seized
his gaoler and attempted to hurl him from the
window. The governor, however, who was more
than a match for Caesar in strength, succeeded in
throwing him to the floor; whereupon, with the
effrontery which never deserted him, the Duke
laughed and explained that he had heard that the
warder was a man of colossal strength and he
wanted to test it for himself, and he had found
the stories were not exaggerated.</p>

<p>This curious episode undoubtedly was the cause
of Caesar’s removal to the more secure fortress of
Medina del Campo, in the northern part of Spain,
which was both a stronghold and a palace and had
been used as a royal residence.</p>

<p>It was about this time that Lucretia Borgia began
to exert herself to obtain her brother’s freedom—efforts
which have been taken as proof of her
affection and devotion to him. Requesenz,
Caesar’s majordomo, interceded for his release
with the King of Spain, who informed him that
while he was not responsible for Valentino’s arrest,
he would, owing to Gonsalvo’s representations, hold
him prisoner, but that, should the charges made
against him prove false, he would accede to the
cardinals’ wishes.</p>

<p>Events conspired to aid the prisoner. Isabella
the Catholic, anticipating that her daughter, Jeanne
la Folle, wife of Philippe le Beau, would never
recover her reason, decided to make her husband
Ferdinand regent of Castile on her death.
Ferdinand was surrounded by enemies, and in the
kingdom of Naples even the loyalty of Gonsalvo<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span>
de Cordova was suspected. Louis XII., in spite of
his defeat at the Garigliano, still maintained his
right to the Regno, while the Emperor Maximilian,
whose son Philippe le Beau, husband of Jeanne
la Folle, had been excluded from the regency
by Isabella’s will, feeling himself aggrieved, determined
to demand his son’s rights. At this juncture
Ferdinand suggested to Louis XII. that they discontinue
their struggle for Naples, and that, as
evidence of good faith, the French King bestow
upon him the hand of his niece, Germaine de Foix,
who was then eighteen years of age, while the
King of Spain was fifty-four. As dowry she would
bring her husband half of the Kingdom of Naples
which had been granted the King of France by
the treaty of Granada. In addition Louis was to
aid Ferdinand to recover Navarre—which on his
death was to be returned to the crown of France—for
Gaston de Foix, brother of the betrothed and
nephew of Louis XII. The treaty of alliance
was signed at Blois, October 12, 1505, and
the marriage was performed March 18, 1506,
at Dueñas.</p>

<p>At the same time the Cortes confirmed Ferdinand
in the possession of Castile, disregarding the fact
that Isabella had willed it to him only on condition
that he did not marry again. Some of the most
powerful members of the Court refused their consent
and declared themselves in favour of Jeanne
and her husband, Philippe le Beau. They elected
the Count of Benavente their leader. The others
ranging themselves on Ferdinand’s side, under Don
Fabrique de Toledo, Duke of Alva, civil war broke
out. At first the King’s party was successful,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span>
whereupon the Emperor Maximilian entered into
the conflict, and his son, Philippe le Beau, hastened
from Flanders and demanded the regency.</p>

<p>The help which the Count of Benavente later
gave Caesar and the relations of the latter with
Maximilian’s ambassadors show that in prison the
Duke was on the side of Philippe, who, as soon as
he came to Spain, established himself at Medina
del Campo.</p>

<p>In October, 1505, Ferdinand, who had already
recalled Gonsalvo de Cordova from Naples and
decided to supplant him with his own son Alfonso
of Aragon, Archbishop of Saragossa, determined,
owing to his lieutenant’s uncertain attitude, to go
to Naples himself. The ten days Gonsalvo had
asked to put the defences in order and arrange
his affairs had elapsed and the King’s suspicions
were strengthened. It was then that he conceived
the idea of using Caesar to crush Gonsalvo.
Thereupon he dispatched Don Pedro de Ayala to
Philippe le Beau at Medina del Campo to demand
his prisoner, saying that he intended to confine
him in the Castle of Ejerica until he was ready
to go to Naples, when he would take him with him
to command his troops.</p>

<p>Fate apparently was about to afford Caesar an
exquisite revenge; he was to lead a Spanish army
against the man who had deceived him and
delivered him into the hands of the Catholic
monarch. Philippe le Beau, however, had his own
plans regarding Caesar, and while Ferdinand desired
to avail himself of his services against
Gonsalvo and Julius II., Maximilian’s son conceived
the idea of using him against the Catholic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span>
sovereign himself in case he persisted in claiming
the regency. From these circumstances it is clear
that Caesar’s ability and energy as a military leader
were universally recognised.</p>

<p>To lend greater authority to his refusal to
surrender Caesar, Philippe le Beau stated that he
would first have to refer the matter to the Council
of Castile to determine whether the Duke was the
prisoner of the King or of Queen Jeanne. In apprehending
him in Naples Gonsalvo indubitably was
acting in the interests of the kingdom of which
Philippe was Regent for his wife, the legitimate
heir. Moreover, the Duke would have to be held
a prisoner until the suit instituted by the Duchess
of Gandia was decided. Ferdinand did not give
up the fight when informed of the Council’s
decision, but requested Don Bernardino de
Cardenas, Governor of the province of Grenada,
to whose care he had committed Caesar, to
surrender his prisoner. Cardenas was disposed to
obey, but asked permission of the Regent, who absolutely
refused to allow Caesar to be given up. The
Governor then explained to the King that even if
he freed Valentino, Philippe would at once seize him
again as he did not have a sufficient force to oppose
the Regent.</p>

<p>Ferdinand set sail for Naples September 4, 1506,
accompanied by his young Queen, and having with
him the flower of his army. About a month later,
October 5th, his son-in-law Philippe, the Regent
of Castile, suddenly died. The Regent was
then only twenty-eight years of age, and he was
so strong and active that it was believed that he
had been poisoned. His widow had still sufficient<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span>
sense left to ask her father to return to Spain, and
to her supplications were added those of his
subjects, who feared the kingdom might become
a prey to the contending factions. Ferdinand, however,
was making good progress in Naples and
was anxious to complete his work; he therefore
refused to come, and Jeanne acted as Regent during
his absence.</p>

<p>The death of Philippe had left Caesar’s guardian,
Don Bernardino de Cardenas, in a peculiar position;
he had directly disobeyed Ferdinand’s
orders, and now, to save himself from the
King’s wrath, he proposed to Luis Ferrer, the
Catholic monarch’s ambassador, to send Caesar to
him in order that he might be transferred to
Aragon. Ferrer, cognisant of the machinations
which had been carried on by Philippe le Beau and
Maximilian with Caesar in prison, promptly
accepted the offer in the name of his sovereign,
but asked Cardenas to keep his prisoner until he
could ascertain Ferdinand’s wishes regarding him.
The Spanish monarch, however, was still in
Naples, and Caesar, informed by Don Bernardino
of what he had done, and unwilling to trust himself
to him, succeeded in making his escape,
October 25, 1506. He arrived at the Court of
his brother-in-law Jean d’Albret December 3, 1506,
suddenly—“like the devil,” as the chronicler Moret
says.</p>

<p>The news of his escape caused consternation in
Italy; Julius II. could never rest as long as Valentino
was at large; the Venetians feared him, and
the King of France immediately took steps to
defend himself against his machinations. Caesar’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>
friends in Romagna, however, immediately recovered
hope.</p>

<p>The Castle of Medina del Campo was the largest
in Spain, and for any one to escape from its gloomy
walls had been deemed impossible. Erected about
the middle of the fifteenth century, in 1460 it fell
into the hands of Fonseca, Archbishop of Seville,
who on his death left it to a cousin. In 1473
it was seized by the first Duke of Alva.</p>

<p>The Count of Benavente undoubtedly aided
Caesar to escape. Valentino had been furnished
a chaplain, and this man probably was the one
who acted as his agent in dealing with the outer
world and also the person who furnished the rope
by means of which Valentino descended from the
tower. One of the servants tried the rope first; it
was found to be too short, and the unfortunate man
fell into the moat, breaking some of his bones;
he was left where he fell and later was apprehended,
tried, and put to death. Caesar had almost reached
the end of the rope when, the alarm having been
given, it was cut, and he also dropped into the
moat. He was injured and had to be carried to
the horse which was held in waiting for him by
his confederates. Putting spurs to their animals,
they never stopped until they reached the little town
of Pozaldez; thence they travelled to Villalon, the
seat of the Count of Benavente. Caesar was now
safe. He had escaped from prison, October 25th,
and not until five weeks later did he reach the
Court of his brother-in-law at Pamplona; it had
taken nearly all this time for him to recover from
his injuries and regain his strength; but he had
also had time to renew his machinations with the
Emperor Maximilian’s ambassadors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>
The records of the investigation which followed
his escape are preserved in the archives of Simancas
and are exceedingly voluminous. The order for
his apprehension, which was issued in the name
of Queen Jeanne, reads as follows: “Sixteenth December
1506. Commission and order is given by
the Queen [titles] to you, Christoval Vasquez de
Acuña, and to our alcaldes and to all of those
to whom this royal letter shall be shown. You
are informed that the Duke of Valentinois, being a
prisoner by my order in the castle of Medina del
Campo, the said Duke has escaped, and I advise
you that I have been informed that he went to
the city of Santander; that there were two persons
mounted on horseback and that they left their
horses in the town of Castres with the son of Pedro
Gonzales Calderon. Thence they went to Santander
where it is said the Duke was apprehended by an
alcalde of the said town, but that the latter released
him on receiving presents from him; once free
he looked for some one to conduct him safe and
sound to Castro-Urdiales to take ship from there.
I require that the Duke be searched for with all
possible diligence; that careful inquiry be made
regarding the persons who left the said horses in
the town of Castres; whither they went and where
they now are; whether the said alcalde actually
had the Duke in his hands and who these persons
were. If these persons embarked, from what port,
on what vessel, and their destination. In a word
I wish you to inform us of everything relevant; and
you will seize the person of the said Duke wherever
you may find him, be this in a church or a
monastery, or any other place, however privileged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>
it may be, and even beyond your jurisdiction, and
that, this done, you keep him in your sight with
a strong guard until you shall have received
further orders. For this purpose I send you the
said letter and direct you to begin a searching
investigation wherever and among all persons who
may be able to give you any information regarding
this matter; and that you procure all information
concerning the said Duke, and that they give
you the means of apprehending him, and that the
sum that you promise them on my account for this
purpose, be paid them in the manner agreed upon.
And if any of them conceal him, cause them to
understand that they incur the risk of death and
that all their goods will be confiscated. And if
you learn that the persons who left their horses in
the said town of Castres were unknown, they must
nevertheless be held until it is ascertained what
they were doing, why and whither they were
travelling.</p>

<p>“To carry out my instructions I give you absolute
power with all the warrants, writs and
authority necessary; and if any one in any way
interferes with you he will be liable to a fine
of ten thousand maravedis to be paid into my
treasury.</p>

<p>“Given in our city of Burgos, 14 December
1506.—Signed <span class="smcap">Jeanne</span>.”</p>

<p>After leaving Villalon Caesar’s destination was
Pamplona, but instead of going there directly he
travelled due north to the Atlantic coast, probably
for the purpose of throwing his pursuers off the
track. At Santander he took a boat. He had two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span>
guides, Martin de la Borda, of Los Passages, near
San Sebastian, and Miguel de la Torre. All three
were mounted on horses furnished by the Count of
Benavente. The travellers passed for grain
dealers; they stated they had come from Medina
del Campo, where certain moneys had been owing
them, which they had placed in a bank, and that
they were now on their way to Santander, where
they expected a boat laden with wheat from France.
At Santander they learned that the vessel had
stopped at Bernico, and in order that they might
not suffer by a decline in price they had to
embark again immediately for this port; thus they
explained their haste.</p>

<p>When they reached the outskirts of Castres,
November 29th, Caesar’s horse and that of Martin
de la Borda could go no farther, and the travellers
entered the town on foot. At Castres they put up
at the inn of one Ruyz Guttierez. Here Valentino
found a vessel-owner with whom he made arrangements
to be taken by sea to the port nearest the
border of Navarre. The witnesses examined
twenty-one days after these events even named the
dishes the travellers had for luncheon—“three
chickens and a large piece of meat.” Scarcely had
they seated themselves at the table when the arrival
was announced of the lieutenant of the corregidor,
who had been informed of the coming of the
mysterious strangers who had no sooner entered
the town than they hurried to Francesco Gonzales
de Santiago, a vessel-owner, and offered him an
extravagant price to take them by sea to Castro-Urdiales.</p>

<p>The official was accompanied by a notary and an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
alguazil, and they questioned the three travellers,
who told a plausible story, and were allowed to go
their ways.</p>

<p>Mary Gonzales de Pertillon, one of the servants
about the inn, testified that one of the travellers
had spoken little; that he was wrapped in his
cloak; that he was a man of medium height,
somewhat heavy, his nostrils wide open, his eyes
large, and that his hand—doubtless injured—was
bound up in a piece of linen.</p>

<p>Owing to the high sea the travellers were unable
to set sail before sunrise, but they finally reached
Castro-Urdiales, where, being unable to procure
horses, they were compelled to remain two days.
At last they obtained some mules and continued
their journey, and some time between December 1st
and 3rd they reached Pamplona. The investigation
disclosed every move made by Caesar and his companions
from the time they left Castres until they
reached the Court of Navarre.</p>

<p>Valentino, informing his friends in Italy of his
escape, stated that he had arrived at Pamplona
December 3, 1506.</p>

<p>When the Council of Castile received the Queen’s
order to institute an investigation, Caesar was
entirely safe; in fact, he had been at the Court of
his brother-in-law nearly two weeks. His two
guides, however, Martin de la Borda and Miguel
de la Torre, were apprehended. It was probably
the news of Caesar’s arrival at Pamplona that
caused the investigation to be instituted, although
of course his escape was known at once. All along
his route witnesses were found, and great was the
astonishment when it was learned that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span>
mysterious traveller was a prisoner of state, for
whose apprehension a reward of ten thousand gold
ducats was offered, and the strangest thing of all
was the fact that the corregidor of Santander had
actually had his hands on Caesar, had questioned
him, and finally had set him free. He evidently
had promptly reported the circumstances, but
when he was informed who the strangers were
the worthy official was dismayed, and he immediately
indited the following frank letter to the
<span class="locked">Queen:—</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Most powerful Lady</span>,—Don Pedro de Mendoza,
your corregidor for the four towns on the
sea-coast, kisses your Majesty’s hand, being informed
by a royal rescript that she requires me to
explain how one of the alcaldes in my jurisdiction
could have apprehended and then set at liberty
the Duke of Valentino.... Your Majesty already
knows everything connected with the arrest of the
said Duke from a previous report of mine, and from
the investigation conducted by the corregidor of
the town of Bilboa and county of Biscay, regarding
this subject. I send no further information,
having given all the particulars furnished by trustworthy
witnesses regarding the persons who conducted
the Duke to the place of embarkation. Your
Majesty may be sure that, if at the time I had the
Duke in my power, I or any of my alcaldes, had
known of his escape, even had he untold wealth
to give us, it would never have entered my head
to do anything contrary to faithful service to your
Majesty, and least of all to set the Duke at liberty,
knowing or even suspecting that it was he whom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>
I had in my hands. At the time I had him in my
power, I did not know he had escaped—in fine, I
did not so much as remember that such a person
existed.</p>

<p class="in0"><span class="pfirst">The</span> last of December, 1506, Caesar’s secretary,
Don Federico, arrived in Italy with letters from
his master announcing his escape. Of these letters,
dated December 7, 1506, one was to the Marquis
of Mantua, and another to the Cardinal of Este.
The former, owing to political reasons, had always
been friendly to Valentino; moreover, his wife
Isabella was a sister of Alfonso d’Este, Caesar’s
brother-in-law. The seal on the letters has the
lilies of France and the Borgia arms, with the inscription,
“Caesar Borgia de France, Duke of
Romagna.”</p>

<p>On arriving in Italy Don Federico immediately
went to Ferrara, where he appeared December 28th
to impart the good news to Lucretia. Two weeks
after leaving Ferrara, Federico was arrested at
Bologna by order of Julius II., and Lucretia wrote<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>
the Marquis of Mantua, who was in the Pope’s
service, and who had just administered a crushing
defeat to Bentivoglio, and annexed his domain to
the States of the Church, telling him that the
messenger had merely come to bring her news of
her brother, and not to attempt anything contrary
to the Pope’s interests or wishes.</p>

<p>It was suspected that Federico had been sent to
feel the pulse of the country, and to ascertain
whether the Romagnols were still loyal to
Valentino.</p>

<p>If Caesar in prison was a source of uneasiness to
the Holy Father, how much more to be feared
was he now, at liberty in Navarre, protected by
the Emperor Maximilian, and likely to appear in
Italy any time, rally his supporters—of whom he
still had many—about him, and endeavour to
recover Romagna, where his rule was preferred to
that of the Pope! It was, therefore, the part of
wisdom to nip his plans in the bud; consequently
Don Federico was seized.</p>

<p>The Court of Navarre was impoverished and
could not be of much help to Caesar, the larger
part of whose fortune consisted of deposits with
the bankers of Genoa; these funds, however, had
been attached by his Holiness. Caesar now
remembered that he was a French prince, Duke
of Valentinois, and entitled to the revenues of the
duchy, in addition to those of the county of Diois—not
to mention those of the salt magazines of
Issoudun, all assured to him by formal contract
at the time of his marriage to Charlotte d’Albret.
Besides, there was the dowry of 100,000 livres
promised by Louis XII. and guaranteed by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span>
royal treasurers, not a sou of which had he ever
received, although it was to have been paid in
November, 1500.</p>

<p>Caesar therefore sent his majordomo Requesenz
to France to press his claim before Louis XII.,
and ask permission to come and take his place at
Court and serve his Majesty.</p>

<p>In January, 1507, the French King was at
Burgos, and there Requesenz presented himself.
Louis not only refused to grant any of Caesar’s
demands, but, February 18th, by letters patent,
formally declared the Duke deprived of the
revenues and lordship of Issoudun. From this
document it is clear that Louis wanted to punish
Caesar for threatening Florence, which he regarded
as treachery; for his attack on Pisa, which was
under the protection of France; and also for his
attempts to expel the King’s ally, Giovanni
Bentivoglio, from Bologna.</p>

<p>Caesar was now thirty-one years of age, and
his one desire was to avenge himself on his enemies,
Julius II., who had deprived him of his estates;
on the King of Spain, who had treacherously imprisoned
him; and on Louis XII., who had taken
all his privileges from him, and who had even
withheld the marriage portion. Louis had used
the Borgia in securing Milan and Naples, and he
had obtained Bretagne thanks to the dispensation
of Caesar’s father permitting his marriage with
Anne.</p>

<p>When Caesar found refuge at the Court of
Navarre, his brother-in-law Jean d’Albret was in
sore straits. On one side he was threatened by
Ferdinand, the Catholic, who had always regarded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span>
Navarre as his prey, and on the other he was
imperilled by the contentions of two factions, one
headed by the Count of Agramont, the other by
Luis de Beaumont, Count of Lerin. Louis XII.
was doing all he could to foment the discord, and
at this juncture D’Albret’s brother-in-law, Caesar,
suggested that the King ask aid of the Emperor
Maximilian, and offer him free passage through
Navarre to Castile and Aragon. This suggestion
immediately approved itself to Jean d’Albret.
Caesar, of course, expected to be made commander
of the forces of Navarre, and he at once
set about putting the castles and strongholds of
the kingdom in condition for defence, and enlisting
such forces as Navarre could equip and
maintain.</p>

<p>The first thing for Jean d’Albret to do was to
put an end to the discord among his own subjects.
Luis de Beaumont was then in possession of the
castle of Viana, and he refused to surrender it on
the King’s demand. His rebellion was of long
standing. Luis had inherited his father’s affection
for Castile, and in 1495 he had entered into an
agreement with Ferdinand, the Catholic, by which
he relinquished his estates in Navarre, and
received in exchange for them equivalent domains
in Castile. Thus he became a vassal of the Spanish
monarch, and at the same time the latter secured
a foothold in the kingdom of Navarre. The convention
was duly ratified, but owing to the difficulty
which was encountered in adjusting the exchange
of estates it was soon abrogated.</p>

<p>Don Juan de Ribera, Captain-General of the
Catholic Monarch, had taken charge of the domain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span>
hitherto in the possession of Beaumont, whose
departure from Navarre had brought peace to the
kingdom. Jean d’Albret of course was incensed
by the occupation of a part of his territory by a
representative of the King of Spain. He therefore
went to Seville to endeavour to reach an understanding
with Ferdinand; this he succeeded in
doing, and the convention included a pardon for
his rebellious count, to whom was also restored
the office of constable and warder of the castle of
Viana, while Don Juan de Ribera, Captain-General
of Castile, returned to him all the estates he had
conveyed to their Catholic Majesties. Luis de
Beaumont was, however, a turbulent soul; his tomb
in the monastery of Veruela bears the inscription:
<i xml:lang="it" lang="it">En un cuerpo tan pequeno nunca se vi tanta fuerza</i>—Never
before in body so small was there such
strength.</p>

<p>Ever since 1505 he had regarded himself as the
rightful owner of the castles, which he was merely
holding for his sovereign, and, forgetful of
D’Albret’s generosity, he refused to submit to him,
and also continued to make inroads on his neighbours’
domains and appropriate their lands. He
was endeavouring to build up a power to oppose the
throne of Navarre and had established himself as
a conqueror in the castle of Viana. While Jean
d’Albret and Caesar were putting the strongholds
of the country in fighting condition, the King sent
an officer to Beaumont to demand the surrender
of the place. Luis had the envoy seized, whipped,
and confined in the castle of Larraga. Incensed
when he was informed of this, and remembering
how he had forgiven the count, the King sent to him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span>
three times and commanded him to appear; on his
failure to do so he charged him with <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">lese-majeste</i>,
declared all his goods confiscate, his titles, honours,
and offices forfeit, and himself condemned to
death.</p>

<p>Supported by Don Alonzo Carilli de Peralta,
Count of San Sebastian, who was also on the side
of Castile, Luis prepared to take the field.</p>

<p>War was declared between the King and his
rebellious vassal, and Caesar, having been
appointed Captain-General of the royal troops, set
out February 11, 1507, to invest Larraga, whose
defence had been entrusted by Beaumont to Ogier
de Verastegui. Caesar attacked with great determination,
but the place resisted bravely. Trusting
to his lieutenants to cut off all means of communication,
Valentino decided to go and attack
Beaumont at his camp near Mendavia, adjacent
to the small town of Viana, on the road to
Logroño.</p>

<p>At Viana, near the frontier of Castile, D’Albret
would be in an excellent position to receive reinforcements
from the Count of Benavente, the Duke
of Najera, and Maximilian’s partisans, who were
anxious to begin a struggle which would open
Castile to the son of Philippe le Beau.</p>

<p>Caesar’s force consisted of a thousand cavalry,
more than two hundred lances, an escort of thirty
men-at-arms, and five hundred foot-soldiers, with
some siege guns and a few field-pieces. It was
his intention to invest Viana, and then seek the
Count, who had entrusted the defence of the town
to his son Luis, and who had himself taken up a
position near Mendavia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span>
Viana, being poorly supplied with provisions
when the troops of Navarre appeared under her
walls, was in no condition to resist a long siege.
The Count of Lerin, aware of this, determined to
re-victual the place; the undertaking was difficult
and would have to be carried out, if at all, by night,
for the Navarrais had entirely surrounded the town.
The plan was favoured by a terrific storm which
occurred during the night of March 11th, when
Beaumont set out from Mendavia with two hundred
lances and six hundred foot-soldiers, some
of whom were armed with blunderbusses, to cover
the line of his convoy, which consisted of sixty
horses laden with flour. Profiting by the darkness,
he advanced up to the very walls of the
castle of Viana with a small force, having concealed
the greater part of his men in a ravine near
the town, so that they might be brought up quickly
if needed. Everything was in his favour—the darkness,
the storm, the relaxed vigilance of the
besiegers, and he succeeded in getting his convoy
into the stronghold by a secret gateway. Elated
by his good fortune, Beaumont twice repeated the
operation, and with equal success. He might have
returned to his camp without being detected, but
he decided to take advantage of the opportunity
and reconnoitre, and, if possible, inflict some loss
on the enemy.</p>

<p>As he was manœuvering his troop they were discovered
by a considerable body of soldiers coming
down the road leading to Logroño who, they
thought, were reinforcements sent by the Duke
of Najera. At sight of Beaumont’s men a shout
went up. The alarm was given in the besiegers’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span>
quarters surrounding the castle. Instantly all was
confusion. Caesar hastily donned his armour,
sprang to his horse, and without waiting to give
any orders dashed out of the gate and down the
Solana road.</p>

<p>“When I was a boy,” says the chronicler Moret,
“I heard old men eighty years of age, who had
it from contemporaries who saw him, say that just
as he dashed through the gate, cursing and swearing,
his horse stumbled and fell.” Believing that
his men were at his heels, the Borgia spurred
straight on toward the rebels, and, coming up to
the rearguard, with his own hand he slew three
of the enemy; oblivious of the fact that he was
alone, he spurred on, cursing the rebels the while.
Suddenly he was discovered by Beaumont, who
ordered some of his men to advance to meet
him.</p>

<p>Among those who did so were Luis Garcia de
Agredo and Pedro de Allo, who succeeded in drawing
him on into a deep ravine, where his followers,
who were far behind, were unable to see him.
There, hidden from the sight of his own people
and also from that of Beaumont’s men, he
engaged in a terrible hand-to-hand fight with his
adversaries.</p>

<p>Valentino fought for his life, but, wounded in
the armpit just as he was about to deliver a blow,
he was unhorsed, and finally, covered with wounds,
was forced to the ground and killed.</p>

<p>His brilliant armour having attracted the attention
of his assailants, they removed it. Entirely
unaware who their victim was, they even took
his weapons and his charger and its accoutrements.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span>
Fearing they might be surprised, they hastily departed,
leaving the body naked on the field of
battle. When the Count of Lerin saw the costly
armour he was incensed because, instead of taking
him alive, they had killed a man evidently of high
rank, and he ordered some of his followers to fetch
the body to his camp at Mendavia. They started
for the ravine, but turned back when they heard
the shouts of the men of Navarre who, in the early
dawn, were searching for the body of their dead
chieftain.</p>

<p>Before retreating, however, Beaumont’s men
succeeded in capturing an unfortunate equerry
whom they had found in manifest grief wandering
about the scene of the conflict. Taken to Beaumont,
he was shown the brilliant armour and asked
to whom it belonged, and “Juanico burst into
tears, exclaiming that he had girded it on his
master, Caesar Borgia of France, Duke of
Romagna, that very morning, and that he had
followed him when he dashed through the gate, but
had lost him from sight owing to the swiftness
of the Duke’s horse.”</p>

<p>In the meantime the King of Navarre was
advancing. After the first surprise his forces rallied
and deployed before the hill upon which Viana
is situated. Beaumont, seeing he was in danger
of being cut off from Mendavia, retired with his
men, leaving the unhappy squire, who immediately
hastened back to the ravine, where he was found
by D’Albret and his followers standing over the
bleeding body of his master. The King had the
corpse taken to Viana, where it was placed in a
tomb before the great altar in the parochial church<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span>
of Santa Maria of Viana, and in the course of the
same year—1507—a magnificent monument was
erected to Caesar’s memory, and upon it was
chiselled the following <span class="locked">epitaph:—</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“Aqui yace en poca tierra<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Al que toda le temia;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">En que la paz y la guerra<br /></span>
<span class="i0">En la su mano tenia.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh! tu que vas a buscar<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cosas dignas de loar!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Si tu loas lo mas digno,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aqui pare tu camino;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No cures de mas andar.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Early in the eighteenth century Father Aleson,
then in Viana, found nothing left of the monument
but two stones which had been inserted in the base
of the main altar. In the “Antequedades de
Navarra” Yanguez Miranda says the destruction of
the sepulchre was, according to oral tradition, which
he gathered from some of the inhabitants of Viana,
due to the order of a fanatical bishop who felt
that the church was desecrated by the presence
of Caesar’s ashes.</p>

<p>The Church of Santa Maria de Viana underwent
extensive repairs about the end of the seventeenth
century, and probably it was at that time that
the tomb was removed. Its destruction may
have been connected with an incident which
occurred long before. In 1498 Pedro de Aranda,
Bishop of Calahorra and Superior of the diocese
of Viana, was examined by Alexander VI. on the
charge of heresy and was condemned and imprisoned
in the Castle of St. Angelo, where he
was held a long time. As a result of his confinement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span>
the bishop died. It is highly probable that
the prelates of the diocese of Viana, which had
been dishonoured in the person of its bishop by
the Borgia, continued to feel resentment toward
the family and that one of Pedro de Aranda’s
successors revenged them by removing Caesar’s
remains from the church. What could have been
more natural than for the officiating priest to have
desired to have removed from his sight all
reminders of the recalcitrant cardinal, the
degenerate son of Alexander VI. whose memory
was already blasted by history? This much is
certain—a bishop did destroy the tomb.</p>

<p>Following Paul Jovius and Tomaso Tomasi, later
historians have placed Caesar’s burial at Pamplona;
but Father Aleson, who continued Moret’s
“Annals of Navarre,” and who lived in Viana, says:
“<i xml:lang="it" lang="it">Asi lo llevaron a Viana, no a Pamplona, como
algunos quisieron decir; y lo depositaron en la
yglesia parocchia de Santa Maria</i>”—Thus they
took the body to Viana, not to Pamplona as some
say, and placed it in the parochial church at Santa
Maria. Then follows a description of the tomb
and the epitaph and the fact of the removal of the
monument. In 1523, only sixteen years after
Valentino’s death, Antonio de Guevara, the Bishop
of Mondoñedo, described the tomb and copied the
epitaph in his “Lettres Morales.”</p>

<p>Tradition indicated that the final resting-place of
Caesar’s remains was just in front of the steps in
the <i xml:lang="it" lang="it">Calle de la Rua</i>, leading to the terrace upon
which the Church of Santa Maria de Viana stands,
and M. Charles Yriarte induced the alcalde of the
town, Don Victor Cereceda, to make an excavation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span>
at the place. The investigation brought to
light a perfectly preserved skeleton—were these the
mortal remains of the son of Alexander VI.?</p>

<p>There was nothing to prove that they were; the
bishop may have wished to consign them to everlasting
oblivion and so placed no mark upon the
tomb. With the skeleton were other bones, which
may have been removed from the church at the
same time, when it was being restored.</p>

<p>Reports of Caesar’s death reached his sister—who
in January, 1505, had become Duchess of
Ferrara—by way of Naples promptly, and she dispatched
one of her servants, a certain Tullio, to
Navarre to ascertain whether the rumour was true.
As he progressed on his journey he became convinced
of the truth of the report, and therefore
returned to Ferrara without going to Navarre. The
last doubt was dispelled when Juanico Grasica, who
had been present at Caesar’s funeral and who had
been sent by King Jean d’Albret to inform Lucretia
of his death, appeared in Ferrara. Alfonso was
absent from his domain, and his brother, Cardinal
Ippolito d’Este was the first to receive the news,
which he immediately directed Jeronimo Magnanini,
the Duke’s secretary, to communicate to his
master. This he did in a long letter giving full
particulars of Caesar’s death taken down from the
lips of his faithful squire Grasica. The details
were confirmed by Costabili, who had just come
from Rome. Accounts of Valentino’s death are
given by Zurita, Moret, Esteban de Garribay, and
Avalos de la Piscina, and all closely agree with
that of Grasica.</p>

<p>Lucretia’s grief was profound and apparently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span>
sincere, and many were the prayers she directed to
be said for the repose of Caesar’s soul. Shortly afterwards
her Court poet, Ercole Strozzi, dedicated his
“Epicedium,” a funeral oration in verse, in honour
of Valentino, to her, but Jacopo Sannazzaro, the
mortal enemy of the Borgia, invited his friends and
all Italy to join him in making merry over “this
happy event.”</p>

<p>Caesar, deprived of the support of the Vatican,
was merely a bold condottiere, a soldier of fortune,
and with these Italy teemed in his day. He was
ready to sell his services to the highest bidder,
provided he could advance his own projects.
Although he was no longer in a position to harm
his enemies, all Italy breathed a sigh of relief when
the news of his death was confirmed; even
Julius II., who was more than a match for Caesar,
felt easier, and henceforth he was able peaceably
to carry on the work of reconstructing the domain
of the Church. Had Valentino survived and
entered the employ of Venice in her conflict with
the Pope for the possession of Romagna, or if he
had taken the side of France when his Holiness
withdrew from the League of Cambray, he might
have recovered his former influence and power.</p>

<p>But all Italy now laughed at the adventurer who
had inscribed on his sword the words, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Aut Caesar,
aut nihil</i>. Still, there were a few individuals who
remained faithful to his memory, and a number
of poets published panegyrics and bewailed the
loss of the hero. Hieronimus Portius, the Strozzi,
Francesco Justolo, and Uberti saw fit to lament
him in more or less polished verse. One of the
most famous of the epitaphs was written by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span>
Jeronimo Casio of Bologna, who had known
<span class="locked">Caesar:—</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“Cesar Borgia che ere della gente<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Per armi et per virtù tenuto un sole;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mancar dovendo, andó dove andar sole<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Phebo, verso la sera, a l’occidente.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Leaving France immediately after his marriage
with Charlotte d’Albret, Caesar had never seen his
wife again, and there is nothing to show that he
regretted her. She was merely a pawn in the
political game, and she had been sacrificed by her
father for his own gain and to further the plans
of Louis XII., on whose marriage to Anne of
Bretagne she had retired to Berri to be as near as
possible to Jeanne of France, his repudiated Queen.
It was not long, however, before she took up her
final residence at Motte-Feuilly, where she occupied
herself with the education of her daughter
Louise, whom the father, Caesar, had never seen.
The Duchess of Valentinois died March 11, 1514,
leaving, as her sole heir, her daughter, who two
years later, when she was seventeen years of age,
married Louis II. de La Trémoille, Viscount of
Thouars and Prince of Talmont, the Chevalier
Bayard, the knight <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">sans peur et sans reproche</i>, who
was slain at the battle of Pavia in 1525. Five
years later she again married, her second husband
being Philippe de Bourbon, Lord of Busset, eldest
son of Pierre de Bourbon.</p>

<p>Caesar also left an illegitimate son, Girolamo,
whose mother is unknown, and who probably died
young, as we find no trace of him after his removal
to Naples about the time of Caesar’s release by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span>
Julius II. He likewise had a natural daughter,
whom he named Lucretia in honour of his sister,
and who subsequently became abbess of San
Bernardino and died at Ferrara in 1573.</p>

<p>Caesar’s mother, Vannozza de’ Catanei, survived
him eleven years. Up to the time of her death she
had maintained close relations with her numerous
children. She lived in Rome and enjoyed a certain
competency, provided for her by Alexander VI.;
she engaged actively in charitable work. The day
of her death, according to the Roman custom, the
announcement was made by the public <span class="locked">crier:—</span></p>

<p>“Messer Paolo gives notice of the demise of
Madonna Vannozza, mother of the Duke of Gandia.
The deceased belonged to the fraternity of the
Gonfalon.”</p>

<p>She left her entire fortune to S. Giovanni in
Lateran. She was interred in Santa Maria del
Popolo, her parish church, and on her tomb her
executor inscribed the following <span class="locked">epitaph:—</span></p>

<p>“To Vannozza Catanea, ennobled by her
children, the Dukes, Caesar of Valentinois, and
Juan of Gandia, the Prince Giuffre of Squillace,
and the Duchess Lucretia of Ferrara. To the
woman rendered illustrious by her integrity, her
piety, her wisdom, and to whom the Hospital of the
Lateran is so greatly indebted, Geronimo Pico, her
testamentary executor, has erected this monument.
She lived seventy-seven years, four months, and
thirteen days, and died November 26, 1518.”</p>

<p>For two centuries the friars of Santa Maria del
Popolo prayed for the repose of her soul, but a
sense of decency or shame finally asserted itself,
and the monument was removed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span>
Lucretia Borgia, Duchess of Ferrara, survived
her brother Caesar twelve years, dying in 1519,
greatly beloved by her people. By her husband
Alfonso d’Este she had five children: Ercole II,
who married Renée of France; Ippolito, who
passed away in 1572; Eleonora, who became a
nun and lived until 1575; Francesco, who survived
until 1576; and Alexander, who died in infancy.
Ercole II., by his wife Renée, daughter of
Louis XII., had five children: Alfonso II.
Cardinal Ludovico d’Este, Donna Anna, Duchess
of Guise, Lucretia, Duchess of Urbino, and
Leonora, who never married.</p>

<p>The Spanish chroniclers contemporary with
Caesar Borgia discovered the hand of God in
his death, which occurred March 12, 1507, on
the anniversary of his premature elevation to the
Bishopric of Pamplona and in his own diocese,
where he had never before set foot!</p>

<p>Transcriber added text from the Title Page to the original book cover.
The result is placed in the Public Domain.</p>

<p>Punctuation and spelling were made consistent when a predominant
preference was found in this book; otherwise they were not changed.</p>

<p>Simple typographical errors were corrected; occasional unbalanced
quotation marks retained.</p>

<p>Ambiguous hyphens at the ends of lines were retained; occurrences
of inconsistent hyphenation have not been changed.</p>

<p>Some illustrations of people had two captions: one in Latin, placed
within the frame of the image, and one in English, printed below
the image. When present and legible, both are shown in printed form
in this eBook.  The Latin spellings sometimes differ from the
English ones.</p>

<p>Text uses the names “Spanocchi” and “Spannocchi” several times;
the latter is correct, but both spellings have been retained here.</p>

<p>The spellings of proper names were not thoroughly checked.</p>

<p>Footnotes, originally at the bottoms of pages, have been
moved to the end of the book, just before the Index.</p>

<p>Index not checked for proper alphabetization or correct page references.</p>

<p>Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</h2>

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.</p>

<h3>Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.</p>

<p>The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
